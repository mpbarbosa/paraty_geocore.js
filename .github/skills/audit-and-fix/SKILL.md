  Orchestrate the full log-audit pipeline in a single pass: run validate-logs

  apply every confirmed fix and update the project roadmap, then run
  purge-workflow-logs to clean up all transient artefacts. Use this skill
  when asked to audit and fix workflow logs end-to-end, or any time you want
  both steps executed without a manual handoff between them.

# audit-and-fix

## Overview

This skill is a thin coordinator that runs the three-step log-remediation
pipeline back-to-back:

```

It adds no new logic of its own. Every decision about what counts as a minor
issue, how to verify it, and how to fix it is governed by the individual
skill files. This skill only defines the execution order and the abort
conditions that apply when running them together.

## Prerequisites

- `$project_root/.ai_workflow/logs/` must exist and contain at least one workflow run
  directory. If it is empty or absent, abort with:

  ```
  ✗ audit-and-fix aborted — no workflow run directories found under
    $project_root/.ai_workflow/logs/. Run a workflow first, then retry.
  ```

## Execution order

### Phase 1 — validate-logs

Execute the full `validate-logs` skill as documented in
`.github/skills/validate-logs/SKILL.md`.

> **Note:** Pass `project_root` to the sub-skill.

**Expected outcome:** `$project_root/.ai_workflow/plan.md` exists and contains one or more
issue blocks.

**Abort condition:** If `validate-logs` produces a `plan.md` with zero
issues (all candidates were already fixed or all were Critical/High), print
a success notice and stop — there is nothing for Phase 2 to do:

```
✓ audit-and-fix complete (no issues to fix)
  validate-logs found 0 confirmed minor issues.
  plan.md is empty — fix-log-issues skipped.
```

### Phase 2 — fix-log-issues

Execute the full `fix-log-issues` skill as documented in
`.github/skills/fix-log-issues/SKILL.md`.

> **Note:** Pass `project_root` to the sub-skill.

Read `$project_root/.ai_workflow/plan.md` (written in Phase 1) and process every `open`
issue.

**Expected outcome:** All issues are `done` or `skipped`, roadmap updated,
all commits pushed.

### Phase 3 — purge-workflow-logs

Execute the full `purge-workflow-logs` skill as documented in
`.github/skills/purge-workflow-logs/SKILL.md`.

> **Note:** Pass `project_root` to the sub-skill.

**Expected outcome:** `$project_root/.ai_workflow/logs/`, `$project_root/.ai_workflow/backlog/`, and
`$project_root/.ai_workflow/summaries/` are deleted. `plan.md` and all other `$project_root/.ai_workflow/`
content are retained.

**Note:** Phase 3 always runs after Phase 2 completes (or is skipped due to
zero issues). It is not skipped when Phase 2 finds nothing to fix — the logs
are stale regardless.

## Abort and resume behaviour

If execution is interrupted mid-phase (e.g., a fix fails verification):

- `plan.md` retains accurate statuses — issues touched so far are `done` or
  `in-progress`; untouched issues remain `open`.
- To resume, invoke `fix-log-issues` directly (not `audit-and-fix`) so
  Phase 1 is not re-run and the existing `plan.md` is not overwritten.
- Run `purge-workflow-logs` manually once `fix-log-issues` has finished.

## Final summary

Print a consolidated summary after all three phases complete:

```
✓ audit-and-fix complete
  Phase 1 — validate-logs:       N issue(s) written to plan.md
  Phase 2 — fix-log-issues:      N fixed  |  N skipped
  Phase 3 — purge-workflow-logs: logs/, backlog/, summaries/ removed
  Roadmap updated: $project_root/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md
```
