# GeoPosition Class - Functional Specification

## Document Information

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Last Updated**: January 2025
- **Status**: Final
- **Purpose**: Language-agnostic functional specification for GeoPosition class implementation
- **Target Audience**: Developers implementing GeoPosition in any programming languages

## Overview

The GeoPosition class is a **pure, referentially transparent, immutable** data wrapper and utility class that encapsulates geographic position information obtained from device geolocation systems (GPS, WiFi, cell tower triangulation, etc.). It provides standardized access to position coordinates, automatic quality classification, and distance calculation capabilities without side effects or mutations.

## Purpose and Motivation

### Problem Statement

Modern geolocation APIs (such as browser Geolocation API, mobile device GPS) provide position data in complex nested structures with multiple properties. Direct manipulation of these structures leads to:

- Verbose and repetitive code
- Inconsistent data access patterns
- Lack of standardized quality assessment
- Missing utility functions for common operations

### Solution

The GeoPosition class addresses these issues by:

- Providing a flattened, simplified data structure
- Automatically classifying position accuracy into standardized quality levels
- Offering utility methods for common geolocation operations
- Ensuring consistent string representations for debugging and logging
- **Implementing referential transparency**: No side effects, predictable outputs
- **Ensuring immutability**: All properties set at construction, no mutation
- **Creating defensive copies**: Input objects are never modified or shared

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract and flatten geographic coordinates from nested geolocation data structures
2. **Quality Classification**: Automatically assess and categorize GPS accuracy quality
3. **Distance Calculation**: Compute great-circle distances between geographic points
4. **Data Validation**: Handle missing or invalid position data gracefully
5. **String Representation**: Provide consistent, readable output for logging and debugging

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Constructor and Initialization

**Description**: Create a new GeoPosition instance from a geolocation position object.

**Input**:

- A position object containing:
    - `coords` (object): Nested coordinates object with:
        - `latitude` (number): Latitude in decimal degrees (-90 to 90)
        - `longitude` (number): Longitude in decimal degrees (-180 to 180)
        - `accuracy` (number): Horizontal accuracy in meters (≥ 0)
        - `altitude` (number or null): Altitude in meters above sea level
        - `altitudeAccuracy` (number or null): Vertical accuracy in meters
        - `heading` (number or null): Direction of travel in degrees (0-360, null if stationary)
        - `speed` (number or null): Speed in meters per second (≥ 0, null if stationary)
    - `timestamp` (number): Unix timestamp in milliseconds when position was acquired

**Output**:

- A GeoPosition instance with all properties extracted and initialized

**Behavior**:

- Create defensive copies of position and coords objects
- Extract all coordinate properties from nested structure
- Calculate and assign accuracy quality classification
- **Do NOT mutate input objects**
- **Do NOT perform side effects (no logging)**

**Validation**:

- No validation required during construction
- Null and undefined values are handled gracefully
- Invalid numeric values are not rejected (handled by display logic)

**Purity Requirements**:

- **Does NOT modify** the original position object or coords object
- **Does NOT log** or perform any side effects
- Creates **defensive copies** of input objects to prevent shared mutable state
- Outputs depend **only on inputs** (referentially transparent)

---

### FR-2: Accuracy Quality Classification (Static)

**Description**: Classify GPS accuracy into standardized quality levels based on accuracy value in meters.

**Input**:

- `accuracy` (number): GPS accuracy value in meters (typically 0-10000)

**Output**:

- `string`: One of five quality classifications:
    - "excellent"
    - "good"
    - "medium"
    - "bad"
    - "very bad"

**Classification Logic**:

| Accuracy Range (meters) | Quality Level | Description |
|-------------------------|---------------|-------------|
| accuracy ≤ 10 | "excellent" | High precision GPS signal |
| 10 < accuracy ≤ 30 | "good" | Good precision, suitable for most applications |
| 30 < accuracy ≤ 100 | "medium" | Moderate precision, WiFi-based location |
| 100 < accuracy ≤ 200 | "bad" | Poor precision, cell tower based |
| accuracy > 200 | "very bad" | Very poor precision, IP-based location |

**Algorithm**:

```text
function classifyAccuracy(accuracy):
    if accuracy <= 10:
        return "excellent"
    else if accuracy <= 30:
        return "good"
    else if accuracy <= 100:
        return "medium"
    else if accuracy <= 200:
        return "bad"
    else:
        return "very bad"
```

**Edge Cases**:

- Negative values: Not expected, but would fall into "very bad" category
- Zero: Returns "excellent" (perfect accuracy, theoretical)
- Very large values (>10000): Returns "very bad"
- NaN or undefined: Implementation-specific handling required

---

### FR-3: Distance Calculation

**Description**: Calculate the great-circle distance between this position and another geographic point using the Haversine formula.

**Input**:

- Current position:
    - `latitude` (number): Latitude of current position in decimal degrees
    - `longitude` (number): Longitude of current position in decimal degrees
- Other position (object):
    - `latitude` (number): Latitude of target position in decimal degrees
    - `longitude` (number): Longitude of target position in decimal degrees

**Output**:

- `number`: Distance in meters between the two positions

**Algorithm - Haversine Formula**:

```text
Given:
- lat1, lon1: coordinates of position 1 (in decimal degrees)
- lat2, lon2: coordinates of position 2 (in decimal degrees)
- R = 6371000 meters (Earth's mean radius)

Process:
1. Convert all coordinates from degrees to radians:
   lat1_rad = lat1 * π / 180
   lon1_rad = lon1 * π / 180
   lat2_rad = lat2 * π / 180
   lon2_rad = lon2 * π / 180

2. Calculate differences:
   Δlat = lat2_rad - lat1_rad
   Δlon = lon2_rad - lon1_rad

3. Apply Haversine formula:
   a = sin²(Δlat/2) + cos(lat1_rad) * cos(lat2_rad) * sin²(Δlon/2)
   c = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1-a))
   distance = R * c

Return: distance (in meters)
```

**Mathematical Details**:

- **sin²(x)**: Sine of x, squared
- **cos(x)**: Cosine of x
- **atan2(y, x)**: Two-argument arctangent function
- **√**: Square root

**Edge Cases**:

- Same position (distance = 0): Should return 0 or near-zero value
- Antipodal points (opposite sides of Earth): Should return ~20,037 km
- Null/undefined coordinates: Implementation-specific error handling required
- Invalid coordinates (out of range): Implementation-specific error handling required

**Accuracy Notes**:

- Assumes Earth is a perfect sphere (R = 6371 km)
- Accurate to within 0.5% for most terrestrial distances
- Less accurate for very short distances (<1 meter) due to rounding
- Not suitable for precise surveying or navigation requiring sub-meter accuracy

---

### FR-4: Accuracy Setter with Automatic Quality Update

**Description**: Update position accuracy value and automatically recalculate quality classification.

**Input**:

- `value` (number): New accuracy value in meters

**Output**:

- None (setter method)

**Behavior**:

1. Store accuracy value in internal property
2. Automatically invoke accuracy quality classification logic
3. Update accuracyQuality property with new classification

**Side Effects**:

- Updates two properties: internal accuracy storage and accuracyQuality

**Synchronization Requirement**:

- The accuracy value and accuracyQuality must always be consistent
- When accuracy changes, accuracyQuality MUST be updated immediately

---

### FR-5: String Representation

**Description**: Generate a human-readable string representation of the position for debugging and logging.

**Input**:

- Current GeoPosition instance state

**Output**:

- `string`: Formatted position information

**Format Specification**:

```text
"ClassName: latitude, longitude, accuracyQuality, altitude, speed, heading, timestamp"
```

**Examples**:

```text
Valid position:
"GeoPosition: -23.5505, -46.6333, good, 760, 0, 0, 1634567890123"

Missing coordinates:
"GeoPosition: No position data"
```

**Formatting Rules**:

1. Start with class name followed by colon and space
2. If latitude or longitude is null/undefined/0, return "ClassName: No position data"
3. Otherwise, format all properties in order, comma-separated:
   - latitude (as-is, decimal number)
   - longitude (as-is, decimal number)
   - accuracyQuality (string)
   - altitude (number or null)
   - speed (number or null)
   - heading (number or null)
   - timestamp (number, Unix milliseconds)

**Missing Data Handling**:

- Null values: Display as "null" or implementation's null representation
- Undefined values: Display as "undefined" or similar
- Zero values: Display as "0"

---

### FR-6: Instance Accuracy Quality Calculation (Deprecated)

**Description**: Calculate accuracy quality for current instance's accuracy value.

**Status**: DEPRECATED - Use the accuracyQuality property instead

**Reason for Deprecation**: This method contains a bug (calls undefined function instead of static method). The accuracyQuality property is automatically maintained and should be used instead.

**Input**: None (uses instance's accuracy property)

**Output**: `string` - Quality classification

**Behavior**: Apply static accuracy quality classification to instance's accuracy value

**Recommendation**: Implementations should either:

- Not implement this method
- Mark it as deprecated with warning
- Fix the bug if implementing for compatibility

## Data Model

### Properties

| Property | Type | Nullable | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| geolocationPosition | object | No | Original position object from geolocation API |
| coords | object | No | Reference to coords property of original object |
| latitude | number | Yes | Latitude in decimal degrees (-90 to 90) |
| longitude | number | Yes | Longitude in decimal degrees (-180 to 180) |
| accuracy | number | Yes | Horizontal accuracy in meters |
| accuracyQuality | string | No | Quality classification (excellent/good/medium/bad/very bad) |
| altitude | number | Yes | Altitude in meters above sea level |
| altitudeAccuracy | number | Yes | Vertical accuracy in meters |
| heading | number | Yes | Direction of travel in degrees (0-360) |
| speed | number | Yes | Speed in meters per second |
| timestamp | number | No | Unix timestamp in milliseconds |

### Coordinate System

- **Latitude**: Decimal degrees, positive = North, negative = South, range: -90 to 90
- **Longitude**: Decimal degrees, positive = East, negative = West, range: -180 to 180
- **Altitude**: Meters above mean sea level, can be negative (below sea level)
- **Heading**: Degrees clockwise from true north, range: 0 to 360
- **Speed**: Meters per second, always ≥ 0
- **Accuracy**: Meters, represents horizontal margin of error, always ≥ 0

## Validation Rules

### V-1: Coordinate Validation

- Latitude must be between -90 and 90 degrees
- Longitude must be between -180 and 180 degrees
- **Note**: GeoPosition class does NOT enforce validation (handled by geolocation API)

### V-2: Accuracy Validation

- Accuracy should be a positive number
- Accuracy of 0 represents perfect accuracy (theoretical)
- **Note**: Negative accuracy is not expected but not explicitly rejected

### V-3: Null Handling

- Null values are preserved and passed through
- No errors thrown for null position properties
- toString() method handles null gracefully

### V-4: Missing Data Handling

- Missing coordinates result in "No position data" message
- Other missing properties (altitude, speed, etc.) are acceptable
- Application logic should check for null values before using data

## Quality Classification Use Cases

### UC-1: Mobile Device Position Validation

**Context**: Mobile device with GPS hardware
**Acceptance Criteria**:

- "excellent" (≤10m): Always accepted
- "good" (11-30m): Always accepted
- "medium" (31-100m): Typically rejected (GPS should be better)
- "bad" (101-200m): Always rejected
- "very bad" (>200m): Always rejected

### UC-2: Desktop Device Position Validation

**Context**: Desktop computer with WiFi/IP-based location
**Acceptance Criteria**:

- "excellent" (≤10m): Always accepted
- "good" (11-30m): Always accepted
- "medium" (31-100m): Accepted (typical for WiFi)
- "bad" (101-200m): Rejected
- "very bad" (>200m): Rejected

### UC-3: Position Update Filtering

**Context**: Continuous position tracking with quality control
**Logic**:

1. Receive new position
2. Create GeoPosition instance
3. Check accuracyQuality property
4. Accept or reject based on device type and quality thresholds
5. If accepted, update application state

## Distance Calculation Use Cases

### UC-4: Proximity Detection

**Scenario**: Determine if user is near a point of interest
**Process**:

1. Create GeoPosition from user's current location
2. Call distanceTo() with point of interest coordinates
3. Compare result with threshold (e.g., 100 meters)
4. Trigger notification if within threshold

### UC-5: Movement Detection

**Scenario**: Detect when user has moved significantly
**Process**:

1. Store previous GeoPosition
2. Receive new position data
3. Create new GeoPosition
4. Calculate distance using distanceTo(previousPosition)
5. If distance > threshold (e.g., 50 meters), consider it significant movement

### UC-6: Distance Display

**Scenario**: Show distance to destinations
**Process**:

1. Get user's current GeoPosition
2. For each destination, call distanceTo(destination)
3. Format and display distances (e.g., "587 meters away")

## Implementation Considerations

### Immutability and Referential Transparency

- **Design Decision**: GeoPosition IS immutable and referentially transparent
- **Rationale**:
    - Pure functions are easier to test, reason about, and debug
    - Immutability prevents bugs from shared mutable state
    - Referential transparency enables better optimization and caching
    - Compatible with functional programming patterns
    - For position updates, create new instances instead of mutating existing ones

### No Side Effects

- Constructor does NOT modify the original position object
- Constructor does NOT log (logging should be done by caller if needed)
- All methods are pure functions (outputs depend only on inputs)
- Defensive copying prevents sharing mutable state with external code

### Performance

- Object creation is lightweight (shallow copying only)
- Distance calculation (Haversine) is moderately expensive (trigonometry)
- For high-frequency updates, consider caching distance calculations
- Immutability enables safe caching and memoization strategies

### Thread Safety

- Class is inherently thread-safe due to immutability
- Multiple threads can safely read from the same instance
- New instances created for updates (no shared mutable state)

### Error Handling

- Constructor does not throw exceptions for invalid data
- Invalid/missing data is handled gracefully (null/undefined preserved)
- Validation and error handling is responsibility of caller

## Integration Points

### Input Sources

- Browser Geolocation API (GeolocationPosition object)
- Mobile device GPS systems
- Desktop WiFi/IP geolocation services
- Simulated/mock position data for testing

### Output Consumers

- PositionManager (singleton position management)
- GeolocationService (position tracking service)
- ReverseGeocoder (coordinate to address conversion)
- UI display components
- Logging and debugging systems

## Testing Requirements

### Test Categories

   - Valid position object with all properties
   - Position with null/undefined properties
   - Position with edge case values (equator, poles, date line)

2. **Accuracy Classification Tests**
   - Boundary values (10m, 30m, 100m, 200m)
   - Values just above and below boundaries
   - Zero accuracy
   - Very large accuracy values (>10000m)

3. **Distance Calculation Tests**
   - Same location (distance = 0)
   - Known distances (validate against reference)
   - Short distances (<100m)
   - Long distances (>1000km)
   - Cross-meridian calculations

4. **Immutability and Purity Tests**
   - Constructor does not mutate input position object
   - Constructor does not mutate coords object
   - Constructor does not log or perform side effects
   - Defensive copies isolate internal state
   - Methods are pure (same inputs = same outputs)
   - No setters exist to modify state after construction

   - Position with missing coordinates
   - Position with null values

### Test Data Examples

**Valid Position** (São Paulo, Brazil):

```js

    latitude: -23.5505,
    longitude: -46.6333,
    accuracy: 15,
    altitude: 760,
    altitudeAccuracy: 10,
    heading: 90,
    speed: 5
  },
  timestamp: 1634567890123
}
```

**Invalid/Missing Position**:

```js
{
  coords: {
    latitude: null,
    longitude: null,
    accuracy: 10,
    altitude: null,
    altitudeAccuracy: null,
    heading: null,
    speed: null
  },
  timestamp: 1634567890123
}
```

**Accuracy Boundary Test Values**:

- 10 → "excellent"
- 10.1 → "good"
- 30 → "good"
- 30.1 → "medium"
- 100 → "medium"
