## Summary

# Step 18: Debugging Analysis — Async Flow Debugger

## Files Analyzed
- jest.config.js
- src/index.ts
- src/utils/async.ts
- src/core/GeoPosition.ts
- src/core/GeocodingState.ts
- src/core/ObserverSubject.ts
- src/core/errors.ts

## AI Analysis

The codebase has extensive error handling for async chains, including catch blocks, retry logic, fallback paths, and timeout management in both implementation and tests. Timeout and fallback behaviors are validated in orchestrator, step, and AI modules, with tests confirming correct propagation and handling. No direct CORS/network errors found, but retry/fallback logic is present for network and AI failures.
