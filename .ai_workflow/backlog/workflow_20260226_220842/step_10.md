## Refactoring Recommendations

### Top 5 Priorities

1. **Add JSDoc Comments** _(Quick Win)_: Enhance maintainability by documenting class and method purposes.
2. **Improve Test Coverage for Edge Cases** _(Quick Win)_: Expand tests for unusual geolocation inputs (e.g., extreme values, malformed objects).
3. **Modularize Utility Functions** _(Quick Win)_: If `distance.js` contains multiple helpers, consider splitting for clarity.
4. **Explicit Error Handling** _(Long-Term)_: Consider custom error classes for geolocation parsing failures.
5. **Performance Optimization** _(Long-Term)_: If used in high-frequency contexts, review for unnecessary object freezing or deep copying.
