# Test Generation Report

## Summary

- **Total Source Files**: 4
- **Total Test Files**: 3
- **Untested Files**: 3
- **Test Coverage**: 25%

## 🚨 Low Coverage

Only 25% of source files have tests. 3 file(s) urgently need testing!

## Untested Files

### src

- src/index.ts
- src/utils/async.ts
- src/core/errors.ts

## 💡 Recommendations

1. Prioritize testing critical business logic files
2. Start with files that have the most dependencies
3. Consider using test generation tools or AI assistance
4. Aim for at least 80% test coverage

## Test Strategy

**Strategic Test Coverage Analysis for paraty_geocore.js**

---

### 1. Coverage Gap Identification

- **Critical Gaps (Critical/High):**
  - No coverage data files found; coverage reporting is not active or missing.
  - No direct evidence of tests for error handling, edge cases, or async utilities.
  - Integration tests exist for browser geolocation, but core modules (GeoPosition, errors, distance, async) lack visible targeted tests.

- **Medium/Low Gaps:**
  - Performance benchmarks present, but not clear if they validate correctness or only measure speed.
  - No evidence of e2e tests or component-level integration for business-critical flows.

---

### 2. Test Prioritization

- **Critical Priority:**
  - Add/restore coverage reporting (coverage/ directory, lcov/json output).
  - Unit tests for core modules: GeoPosition, errors, distance, async.
  - Error handling and edge case validation for all core logic.

- **High Priority:**
  - Integration tests for cross-module interactions (GeoPosition + distance, async + errors).
  - Business-critical flows (geolocation, position calculation, error propagation).

- **Medium Priority:**
  - Performance benchmarks with correctness assertions.
  - Quick wins: Add missing unit tests for utility functions.

- **Long-Term:**
  - Maintain coverage >90% for all critical modules.
  - Regular review of test portfolio for new features and refactors.

---

### 3. Test Portfolio Balance

- **Current State:**
  - Heavy on unit and integration tests for geolocation; lacking for core utilities and error handling.
  - No evidence of e2e tests or test pyramid compliance.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Increase unit test coverage for all core modules.
  - Add integration tests for module interactions.
  - Introduce e2e tests for business flows (small effort).
  - Avoid over-testing trivial getters/setters; focus on logic and error paths.

---

### 4. New Test Recommendations

- **Unit Tests (Small/Medium):**
  - GeoPosition: edge cases (invalid input, boundary values).
  - errors: custom error propagation, error wrapping.
  - distance: calculation accuracy, invalid coordinates.
  - async: concurrency, error scenarios.

- **Integration Tests (Medium):**
  - GeoPosition + distance: end-to-end position calculation.
  - Error handling across modules.

- **E2E Tests (Medium):**
  - Geolocation workflow: simulate user/device interaction, error recovery.

- **Effort Estimate:**
  - Initial coverage restoration: Small.
  - Core module unit/integration tests: Medium.
  - E2E flows: Medium.

---

**Strategic Roadmap:**
1. Restore coverage reporting and validate baseline.
2. Prioritize unit/integration tests for core modules and error handling.
3. Add e2e tests for business-critical flows.
4. Maintain and review test portfolio quarterly for balance and coverage.
