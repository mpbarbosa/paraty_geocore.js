# Dependency & Environment Analysis Report

## 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment
- ✅ No known vulnerabilities found in the 4 listed development dependencies (`@types/jest`, `jest`, `ts-jest`, `typescript`).
- No immediate remediation required.
- **Recommendation:** Maintain regular audits (e.g., `npm audit`), monitor transitive dependencies, and enable automated security alerts (Dependabot).

## 2. Version Compatibility Analysis
- ✅ All packages are up to date; no version conflicts or breaking changes detected.
- Semver ranges should be reviewed in `package.json` to ensure consistency (prefer `^` for minor/patch updates, pin major versions for stability).
- **Recommendation:** Pin major versions for critical tools (e.g., `typescript`, `jest`) and review compatibility with your Node.js version.

## 3. Dependency Tree Optimization
- No unused or duplicate dependencies detected (only 4 dev dependencies, 0 prod).
- Bundle size is not a concern for dev-only packages.
- **Recommendation:** Periodically run `npm prune` and `depcheck` to ensure no unused packages accumulate.

## 4. Environment Configuration Review
- Ensure `typescript` and `ts-jest` versions are compatible with your TypeScript codebase and Node.js runtime.
- Confirm `jest` configuration matches your test environment.
- **Recommendation:** Specify minimum required Node.js and npm versions in `package.json` (`"engines"` field), and separate dev/prod dependencies clearly.

## 5. Update Strategy Recommendations
- Continue prioritizing security updates, followed by bug fixes and features.
- Use automated tools (Dependabot, Renovate) for dependency update PRs and vulnerability alerts.
- Test updates in CI before merging; use semantic versioning for safe upgrades.
- **Recommendation:** Document your update/testing workflow and automate dependency checks in your CI pipeline.

**Summary:**  
Your project is secure and dependencies are current. Maintain regular audits, automate updates, and document environment requirements for long-term stability. No immediate actions required.

```

**Change List & Justifications:**
- Added `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, `author`, `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`, and `keywords` for complete metadata and discoverability.
- Set `main` and `types` to point to built output for runtime and TypeScript support.
- Defined scripts for `start`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `format`, and pre-hooks for best practice automation.
- Placed `typescript`, `jest`, `eslint`, and `prettier` in `devDependencies` (not needed in production).
- Set `"private": true` to prevent accidental npm publish.
- Specified minimum Node.js and npm versions in `engines` for compatibility.
- Set `"type": "module"` for native ESM support.
- No security issues found (audit clean); no breaking changes required.
- No runtime dependencies present; all dev tooling is up to date and correctly classified.
