## AI Recommendations

1. Add a dedicated test/ directory for unit and integration tests to improve code quality and maintainability.
2. Create a docs/api/ subdirectory for API documentation and docs/guides/ for user and developer guides.
3. Consider adding a scripts/ directory for build, deployment, and utility scripts.
4. Ensure each src/ subdirectory (core, utils) contains only relevant code, and add src/lib/ or src/modules/ if the project grows.
