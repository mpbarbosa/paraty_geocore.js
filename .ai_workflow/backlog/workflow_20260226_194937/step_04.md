**Configuration Validation Report**

---

**Summary:**  
All configuration files validated successfully.  
- Files checked: package.json, .workflow-config.yaml, .workflow_core/config/ai_helpers.yaml, .github/workflows/*.yml (CI, release, codeql, coverage-comment, dependency-review)  
- Validations performed: syntax, security, consistency, best practices, AI workflow config structure

---

**Noteworthy Best Practices:**
- No exposed secrets or hardcoded credentials found (all secrets use GitHub Actions secrets).
- Dependency versions are pinned in package.json; dev/prod separation is clear.
- CI/CD workflows use caching, matrix builds, and security audits.
- AI prompt YAML uses anchors for token efficiency and behavioral_guidelines pattern.
- Configuration files are well-commented and follow schema standards.

---

**Details:**  
- **Security:** No CRITICAL issues. All secrets (CODECOV_TOKEN, NPM_TOKEN) are referenced via `${{ secrets.* }}`. No hardcoded credentials or insecure defaults.
- **Syntax:** All JSON/YAML files parsed without errors. No malformed structures or invalid escaping.
- **Consistency:** Dependency versions match across package.json and lockfiles. CI/CD commands align with documented build/test/lint scripts.
- **Best Practices:** Environment-specific configs, Docker caching, and artifact management are present. AI workflow config uses YAML anchors and role_prefix + behavioral_guidelines pattern.

---

**Impact:**  
- Build, deployment, and workflow automation are robust and secure.
- No immediate action required; configuration is production-ready and follows industry standards.
