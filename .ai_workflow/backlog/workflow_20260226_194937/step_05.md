## AI Recommendations

1. Ensure all documentation files are placed in the `docs` directory and update the directory to include organized subfolders (e.g., `docs/api`, `docs/guides`).
2. Add missing subdirectories for tests and utilities: create `test/utils` and `src/lib` if the project uses library modules.
3. Review and resolve the 5 reported issues—clarify their nature (e.g., misplaced files, naming inconsistencies) and address each with targeted directory or file moves.
