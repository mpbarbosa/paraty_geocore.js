# Shell Script Documentation Validation Report

## Scripts Analyzed
- `cdn-delivery.sh`
- `scripts/deploy.sh`

## 1. Script-to-Documentation Mapping

**Findings:**
- Both scripts are referenced in the main `README.md` under "Release & Automation Scripts".
- Paths in documentation match actual file locations.
- Descriptions in README.md accurately reflect script functionality.
- Usage examples (`bash scripts/deploy.sh`, `bash cdn-delivery.sh`, `npm run cdn`) are present and correct.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 2. Reference Accuracy

**Findings:**
- Command-line arguments in documentation match script usage (`bash scripts/deploy.sh`, `bash cdn-delivery.sh`).
- Version numbers in README.md and scripts are consistent (`0.9.3-alpha`).
- Cross-references (e.g., `cdn-delivery.sh` called by `deploy.sh`) are accurate.
- File path references in comments and documentation are correct.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 3. Documentation Completeness

**Findings:**
- Purpose/description is present for both scripts in README.md and script headers.
- Usage examples and command syntax are provided.
- Prerequisites (Node.js, npm, git, curl) are documented.
- Output/return value documentation is present (console messages, committed artifacts, CDN URLs).

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 4. Script Best Practices (Project-Specific)

**Findings:**
- Executable permissions are not explicitly documented (recommend adding a note if scripts are not executable by default).
- Shebangs (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) are present in both scripts and mentioned in script headers.
- Environment variable requirements are documented in script comments (e.g., `GITHUB_USER`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
- Error handling (`set -euo pipefail`) and exit codes are present in scripts, but not explicitly documented in README.md.

**Issues:**  
- **Low Priority:** Add a note in README.md about setting executable permissions if needed (`chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh`).
- **Medium Priority:** Document error handling and exit code conventions in README.md or script headers.

## 5. Integration Documentation

**Findings:**
- Workflow relationships (deploy script calls CDN script) are documented in README.md.
- Execution order and dependencies are clear.
- Common use cases and examples are provided.
- Troubleshooting guidance is not present.

**Issues:**  
- **Medium Priority:** Add a "Troubleshooting" section to README.md for common errors (e.g., missing dependencies, git tag conflicts).

## 6. DevOps Integration Documentation

**Findings:**
- No CI/CD pipeline, container, or infrastructure-as-code scripts found in the analyzed scope.
- Deployment automation is documented via `scripts/deploy.sh`.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing note on executable permissions                                | README.md               | Low      | Add: `If not executable, run: chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh cdn-delivery.sh`                  |
| Error handling and exit codes not documented                          | README.md, script heads | Medium   | Add: "Scripts use set -euo pipefail; exit code 0 = success, nonzero = error"               |
| Missing troubleshooting guidance                                      | README.md               | Medium   | Add: "Troubleshooting" section with common errors (e.g., missing git, npm, curl, tag exists)|

---

## Example Remediation

**Add to README.md:**
```markdown
### Script Permissions
If scripts are not executable, run:
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh cdn-delivery.sh

### Error Handling
Both scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling. Exit code 0 indicates success; any nonzero exit code indicates an error.

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing dependencies:** Ensure Node.js, npm, git, and curl are installed.
- **Git tag already exists:** Delete or rename the tag before running deploy.
- **Permission denied:** Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x ...`).
```

## Overall Documentation Quality

**Status:** Good  
**Improvements Needed:** Minor (permissions, error handling, troubleshooting)  
**Priority:** Medium (for best practices and user experience)
