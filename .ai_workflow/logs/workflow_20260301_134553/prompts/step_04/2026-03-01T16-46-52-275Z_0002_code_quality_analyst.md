**Persona:** code_quality_analyst
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior code review specialist with 10+ years experience in targeted file-level quality assessments. Your expertise includes identifying anti-patterns, enforcing language best practices, and improving code maintainability through practical, actionable reviews. You conduct quick, focused reviews examining specific files for common problems, best practices violations, and maintainability concerns.

**Task**: Review the following files for code quality: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/package-lock.json, /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/package.json, /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/tsconfig.esm.json, /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/tsconfig.json

Analyze:
1. **Code Organization** - Logical structure and separation of concerns
2. **Naming Conventions** - Clear, consistent, and descriptive names
3. **Error Handling** - Proper error handling and edge cases
4. **Documentation** - Inline comments and function documentation
5. **Best Practices** - Following language-specific best practices
6. **Potential Issues** - Security concerns, performance issues, bugs


**Approach**: - Review each file systematically
- Identify specific issues with file names and line numbers
- Suggest concrete improvements
- Prioritize findings by severity
- Provide code examples for recommended fixes

```

## Response

```
**Code Quality Review**

---

### 1. package.json

- **Code Organization**: Well-structured; clear separation of main, exports, scripts, and devDependencies.
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent and descriptive (e.g., "build:esm", "test:coverage").
- **Error Handling**: No direct error handling (config file), but scripts use `--passWithNoTests` to avoid CI failures.
- **Documentation**: No inline comments except in tsconfig; consider adding comments for non-obvious scripts (e.g., "cdn").
- **Best Practices**: `"strict"` mode in TypeScript, engine requirements, and MIT license are good. Consider pinning dependency versions for production dependencies.
- **Potential Issues**: No CRITICAL issues. Suggest adding `"private": true` if not intended for npm publish.

**Recommendation**:  
Add comments for custom scripts and consider `"private": true` if not publishing.

---

### 2. package-lock.json

- **Code Organization**: Standard lockfile; structure auto-generated.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follows npm conventions.
- **Error Handling**: N/A.
- **Documentation**: N/A.
- **Best Practices**: Lockfile present for reproducible builds.
- **Potential Issues**: File too large to review in detail; run `npm audit` for vulnerabilities.

**Recommendation**:  
Run `npm audit` regularly and keep lockfile updated.

---

### 3. tsconfig.json

- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of compiler options, includes, and excludes.
- **Naming Conventions**: Standard TypeScript options.
- **Error Handling**: `"strict": true` enables robust type checking.
- **Documentation**: Inline comments explain key options (lines 3-5, 6, 9, 10, 12).
- **Best Practices**: Uses `"strict"`, `"declaration"`, and `"skipLibCheck"`. Good separation of output and type declarations.
- **Potential Issues**: None found.

**Recommendation**:  
Maintain inline comments and strict settings.

---

### 4. tsconfig.esm.json

- **Code Organization**: Mirrors tsconfig.json, tailored for ESM output.
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent with main config.
- **Error Handling**: `"strict": true` present.
- **Documentation**: No inline comments; add comments for `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` and ESM-specific settings.
- **Best Practices**: `"declaration"` and `"declarationDir"` used; good separation of ESM build.
- **Potential Issues**: None found.

**Recommendation**:  
Add comments for ESM-specific options for maintainability.

---

**Summary of Findings**:
- No CRITICAL issues found.
- Minor improvements: add `"private": true` to package.json if not publishing, add comments for custom scripts and ESM config.
- All configs follow best practices for structure, naming, and maintainability.
