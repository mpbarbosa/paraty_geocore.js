recommendations for improving documentation quality.

# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
## Severity Assessment
- **Overall Quality:** Needs Improvement (due to widespread MD009 and MD026 violations)
- MD009 (trailing spaces) is high severity; MD026 (header punctuation) is medium; MD007 (list indentation) is excellent; MD047 (final newline) not scanned.

## Critical Issues
- **MD009:** 406 files with trailing spaces (e.g., `.workflow_core/advanced/CUSTOM_WORKFLOW_CREATION.md`—96+ violations, `.workflow_core/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`—24 violations). Trailing spaces can cause rendering artifacts and accessibility issues.
- **MD026:** 30 files with header punctuation (e.g., `.workflow_core/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`—"## Questions?", `.workflow_core/docs/guides/FAQ.md`—40+ violations). Header punctuation reduces clarity and can confuse screen readers.

## Quick Fixes
- **Trailing spaces:** `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- **Final newline:** `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`
- **Header punctuation:** `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(##\+ [^#]*\)[.!?,:;]$/\1/' {} +`

## Editor Configuration
- Add to `.editorconfig`:
  ```
  [*.md]
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  insert_final_newline = true
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 4
  ```
- VS Code: Enable "Trim Trailing Whitespace" and "Insert Final Newline" in settings.

## Prevention Strategy
- Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., `pre-commit` with `trailing-whitespace`, `end-of-file-fixer`, and custom header punctuation regex).
- Automate linting in CI workflows; fail builds on enabled rule violations.
- For AI-generated markdown, post-process with scripts to fix whitespace, header punctuation, and enforce final newline.
