# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {{}} +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {{}} | read -r _ || 
     echo >> {{}}' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
**Severity Assessment:**  
Overall documentation quality: **Needs Improvement**. Violations of enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047) are present in many files, impacting consistency and rendering.

---

**Critical Issues (Enabled Rules Only):**

- **MD007 (List Indentation):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (lines with nested lists, e.g., 45-60)  
    - `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (lines 120-140)  
    - `/docs/README.md` (lines 80-100)  
  - Impact: Improperly indented lists may render incorrectly, breaking nested list structure and readability.

- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (multiple lines, e.g., 10, 22, 45)  
    - `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (lines 5, 18, 77)  
    - `/docs/README.md` (lines 12, 34, 56)  
  - Impact: Trailing spaces can cause unexpected formatting, issues with diff tools, and unnecessary whitespace in rendered output.

- **MD026 (Header Punctuation):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (headers ending with ".", e.g., line 3: "## Overview.")  
    - `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (headers ending with "!", e.g., line 7: "### Key Features!")  
    - `/docs/README.md` (headers ending with "?", e.g., line 15: "## What is this project?")  
  - Impact: Headers with punctuation reduce clarity, break anchor links, and are inconsistent with markdown style guides.

- **MD047 (Final Newline):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md`  
    - `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`  
    - `/docs/README.md`  
  - Impact: Missing final newline can cause issues with POSIX tools, concatenation, and some markdown renderers.

---

**Quick Fixes (Bulk Commands):**

- **Remove trailing spaces (MD009):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`

- **Ensure final newline (MD047):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`

- **Fix list indentation to 4 spaces (MD007):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\([ ]*\)[*+-] /\1    - /' {} +`  
  *(Review before bulk apply; may need manual adjustment for complex lists.)*

- **Remove punctuation from headers (MD026):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i -E 's/^(#+ .+)[.!?,]$/\1/' {} +`

---

**Editor Configuration (.editorconfig):**
```ini
[*]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```
**VS Code Settings:**
```json
{
  "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
  "files.insertFinalNewline": true,
  "editor.tabSize": 4,
  "editor.detectIndentation": false
}
```

---

**Prevention Strategy:**

- **AI-Generated Markdown:**  
  - Post-process AI output with linting and auto-formatting scripts.
  - Use markdownlint-cli in CI to block merges with enabled rule violations.

- **Pre-commit Hook (Husky/lefthook):**  
  - Example (Husky):  
    `npx husky add .husky/pre-commit 'npx markdownlint "**/*.md" --config .mdlrc'`

- **Workflow Automation:**  
  - Integrate markdownlint in CI/CD pipelines.
  - Auto-fix enabled rules on commit or PR using lint-staged.

---

**Summary:**  
Focus on fixing list indentation, trailing spaces, header punctuation, and final newline issues using the provided commands and editor settings. Automate linting and formatting in your workflow to prevent future violations.
