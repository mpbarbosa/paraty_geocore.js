# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {{}} +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {{}} | read -r _ || 
     echo >> {{}}' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
Severity Assessment  
Overall documentation quality: **Needs Improvement** (based on enabled rules). Frequent violations of list indentation (MD007), trailing spaces (MD009), header punctuation (MD026), and missing final newlines (MD047) reduce readability and consistency.

Critical Issues  
- **MD007 (List Indentation)**: Many files (e.g., `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md`, `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.ai_workflow/backlog/*/step_06.md`) have nested lists with incorrect indentation. This can break list rendering, causing items to appear as paragraphs or misaligned bullets.
- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces)**: Widespread across all top 10 files, especially in `.ai_workflow/backlog/` and `/docs/`. Trailing spaces can cause formatting inconsistencies and issues with some markdown renderers.
- **MD026 (Header Punctuation)**: Headers ending with punctuation (e.g., "Requirements.") in `/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` and `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` may be misinterpreted by screen readers and reduce clarity.
- **MD047 (Final Newline)**: Several files lack a final newline, which can cause problems with concatenation, diff tools, and some markdown parsers.

Quick Fixes  
- **Remove trailing spaces:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- **Ensure final newline:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`
- **Fix list indentation (4 spaces for nested):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\([ ]*\)[*-] /\1    - /' {} +`  
  *(May require manual review for deeply nested lists)*
- **Remove header punctuation:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '/^#/ s/[.!?,]$//' {} +`

Editor Configuration  
Add to `.editorconfig`:
```
[*]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```
VS Code settings:
- `"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true`
- `"files.insertFinalNewline": true"`
- `"editor.tabSize": 4`
- `"editor.detectIndentation": false`

Prevention Strategy  
- **AI Generation:** Enforce style guide for lists and headers in prompt templates; post-process AI output with linting scripts.
- **Pre-commit Hook:**  
  Use `pre-commit` with `markdownlint` and auto-fix scripts:
  ```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint
    hooks:
      - id: markdownlint
        args: [--fix]
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: fix-md-whitespace
        name: Remove trailing spaces and add final newline
        entry: bash -c 'find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i "s/[[:space:]]*$//" {} +; find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c "tail -c1 \"$1\" | read -r _ || echo >> \"$1\"" _ {} \;'
        language: system
  ```
- **Workflow Automation:** Integrate markdownlint and auto-fix scripts in CI; fail builds on enabled rule violations.

Summary:  
Focus on correcting list indentation, trailing spaces, header punctuation, and final newlines using the provided commands and editor settings. Automate fixes and enforce rules via pre-commit hooks and CI to maintain documentation quality.
