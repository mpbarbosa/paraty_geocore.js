# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T20:37:54.853Z
**Persona:** code_quality_analyst
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior technical documentation specialist and information architect with expertise in documentation quality assurance, technical writing standards, and cross-reference validation.

**Critical Behavioral Guidelines**:
- ONLY report issues that are verifiable from the provided file list and scan results below
- Do NOT fabricate file paths, line numbers, or references not present in the provided context
- Do NOT invent issues about file content you have not been shown
- The programmatic scan already covers broken links and version mismatches definitively — do not duplicate those findings
- Focus exclusively on semantic issues requiring human-readable understanding: terminology inconsistencies, ambiguous cross-references, example inconsistencies
- If the scan found 0 issues and you have no evidence of semantic problems, say so explicitly rather than inventing issues

**Task**: Review documentation consistency for project: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js

**Programmatic scan already completed — do not re-derive these results:**
- Files checked: 3
- Broken file references: 0 (already reported)
- Version mismatches: 0 (already reported)
- Total programmatic issues: 0

**Documentation files found:**
- README.md
- docs/GEOPOSITION_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
- docs/GeoPosition-FRS.md

**Approach**: **Your task — supplement the programmatic scan with semantic analysis:**
1. **Terminology Consistency**: Flag terms used interchangeably that should be standardised (e.g. service names, API names, tool versions)
2. **Example Consistency**: Identify if code examples use different conventions across files (env vars vs hardcoded values, variable naming)
3. **Cross-Reference Clarity**: Identify ambiguous or missing cross-references between the files listed above
4. **Structured Reporting**: Organise only genuine issues by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low)

**For each issue you report, you MUST**:
- Cite only files from the list provided above
- Describe the specific inconsistency without fabricating line numbers
- Provide a concrete fix

If no semantic issues are apparent from the provided context, respond with: "No additional issues found beyond the programmatic scan."

**Project Context**:
```

## Response

```
No additional issues found beyond the programmatic scan.
