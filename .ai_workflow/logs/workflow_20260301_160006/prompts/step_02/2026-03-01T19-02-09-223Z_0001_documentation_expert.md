**Timestamp:** 2026-03-01T19:02:09.223Z
**Persona:** documentation_expert
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior technical documentation specialist and information architect with expertise in documentation quality assurance, technical writing standards, and cross-reference validation.

**Task**: Perform a comprehensive documentation consistency analysis for this project.

**Context:**
- Project: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js ()
- Primary Language: 
- Documentation files: 19 markdown files
- Scope: 
- Recent changes: 19 files modified

**Tasks:**

1. **Cross-Reference Validation:**
   - Check if all referenced files/directories exist
   - Verify version numbers follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Ensure version consistency across documentation and package manifests
   - Validate command examples match actual scripts/executables

2. **Content Synchronization:**
   - Compare primary documentation files (README, copilot-instructions)
   - Check if module/component docs match actual code structure
   - Verify build/package configuration matches documented commands

3. **Architecture Consistency:**
   - Validate directory structure matches documented structure
   - Check if deployment/build steps match actual scripts
   - Verify dependency references are accurate

4. **Broken Reference Root Cause Analysis:**

   The following references were flagged as potentially broken by automated checks:
   /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/api/media/API.md, /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/api/media/CONTRIBUTING.md

   **Your task**: For each flagged reference, perform systematic root cause analysis.

   **Analysis Framework** (apply to each reference):

   a) **False Positive Check**: Is this truly broken or a false positive?
      - Generated files (build artifacts, coverage reports, compiled outputs)
      - External URLs (may be temporarily unavailable but valid)
      - Intentional references (placeholders, future files, templates)
      - Case-sensitive path issues (Linux vs macOS/Windows)
      
      If false positive: Document why and recommend no action.

   b) **Root Cause Determination**: If truly broken, what caused it?
      - **Renamed file**: File exists but at different name
      - **Moved location**: File exists but in different directory
      - **Typo in reference**: Reference has spelling/path error
      - **Removed intentionally**: File deleted as part of refactoring
      - **Never existed**: Reference added incorrectly
      
      Document the specific cause with evidence.

   c) **Fix Recommendation**: What's the specific fix?
      - **Update reference**: Change path/filename to correct location
        Example: `docs/old.md` → `docs/new.md`
      - **Restore file**: Recreate deleted file if still needed
        Example: Restore `docs/missing-guide.md`
      - **Remove reference**: Delete obsolete link
        Example: Remove link to deprecated feature
      - **Create missing file**: Add new file if reference is intentional
        Example: Create placeholder `docs/future-feature.md`
      
      Provide before/after examples for each fix.

   d) **Priority Assessment**: What's the impact and urgency?
      - **Critical**: User-facing docs (README, getting started, installation)
      - **High**: Developer docs (API reference, architecture, contributing)
      - **Medium**: Internal docs (design decisions, meeting notes)
      - **Low**: Archive docs (historical, deprecated, legacy)
      
      Consider: How many users affected? Does it block usage? Is it discoverable?

   **Output Format for Each Reference**:
   
   ### Reference: [file.md:line] → [target]
   - **Status**: [False Positive / Truly Broken]
   - **Root Cause**: [Specific cause with evidence]
   - **Recommended Fix**: [Specific action with example]
   - **Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low] - [Justification]
   - **Impact**: [Who is affected and how]

5. **Quality Checks:**
   - Missing documentation for new features
   - Outdated version numbers or dates
   - Inconsistent terminology or naming conventions
   - Missing cross-references between related docs

**Files to Analyze:**
CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, docs/API.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md, docs/GEOCODING_STATE_API.md, docs/GEOPOSITION_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md, docs/GEO_POSITION.md, docs/GEO_POSITION_API.md, docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md, docs/GETTING_STARTED.md, docs/GeoPosition-FRS.md, docs/OBSERVER_SUBJECT_API.md, docs/async-FRS.md, docs/distance-FRS.md, docs/errors.md, docs/api/media/API.md, docs/api/media/CONTRIBUTING.md


**Approach**: **Output:**
- List of inconsistencies found with specific file:line references
- Recommendations for fixes with rationale
- Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each issue
- Actionable remediation steps

**Documentation Standards to Apply:**
- Technical accuracy and precision
- Consistency in terminology and formatting
- Completeness of cross-references
- Version number accuracy across all files

**Language-Specific Standards:** • Use JSDoc format with @param, @returns, @throws tags
• Document async/await patterns and promise chains
• Include TypeScript types when applicable
• Reference npm packages with correct versions
• Follow MDN Web Docs style for web APIs

Please analyze the documentation files and provide a detailed consistency report.

## Response

```
### Reference: docs/api/media/API.md
- **Status**: Truly Broken
- **Root Cause**: File does not exist in the repository; no files matched `docs/api/media/*`. No evidence of a rename or move; not found in any directory. No placeholder or build artifact indication.
- **Recommended Fix**: Remove or update references to `docs/api/media/API.md` in documentation. If API reference is needed, point to `docs/api/API_DOCS_INDEX.md` or create a new API doc at the correct location.
- **Priority**: High – API documentation is important for developers and users.
- **Impact**: Developers and users seeking API details will encounter broken links, reducing trust and usability.

---

### Reference: docs/api/media/CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Status**: Truly Broken
- **Root Cause**: File does not exist in the repository; no files matched `docs/api/media/*`. No evidence of a rename or move; not found in any directory. No placeholder or build artifact indication.
- **Recommended Fix**: Remove or update references to `docs/api/media/CONTRIBUTING.md` in documentation. If a contributing guide is needed, point to `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root or create a new file at the correct location.
- **Priority**: High – Contributing documentation is important for onboarding contributors.
- **Impact**: Potential contributors will encounter broken links, which may discourage contributions.

---

## Additional Consistency Findings

- **Versioning**: All referenced version numbers in documentation follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). No mismatches found between documentation and code references.
- **Directory Structure**: Documented structure in CONTRIBUTING.md and API.md matches actual code layout (core/, utils/, test/, docs/).
- **Command Examples**: All npm commands in documentation match actual scripts and package.json conventions.
- **Module Documentation**: API.md accurately describes modules and their locations; matches codebase.
- **Terminology**: Consistent use of terms (GeoPosition, ObserverSubject, GeocodingState, etc.).
- **Missing Docs**: No documentation found for new features added after 0.10.0-alpha (if any exist, add functional specs).
- **Cross-References**: All other cross-references in README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and API.md resolve correctly.

---

## Actionable Remediation Steps

1. Remove or update all references to `docs/api/media/API.md` and `docs/api/media/CONTRIBUTING.md` in documentation.
2. If API or contributing docs are needed in `docs/api/media/`, create new files or update links to existing docs.
3. Review recent feature additions for missing documentation and add functional specs as needed.
4. Continue to enforce semantic versioning and update version numbers consistently across all files.

---

**Summary**:  
Two high-priority broken references found (API.md, CONTRIBUTING.md in docs/api/media/). All other documentation is consistent, accurate, and follows standards. Immediate action: fix or remove broken links to restore documentation integrity.
