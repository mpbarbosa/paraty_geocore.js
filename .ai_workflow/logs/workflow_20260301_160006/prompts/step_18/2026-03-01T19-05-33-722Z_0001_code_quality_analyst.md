**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Approach**: **Step 1: Async Chain Mapping**
Create execution flow with step numbers:
```
1. [Start] async function workflow()
2. await step1() → SUCCESS
3. await step2() → FAILED ← Break point
4. [Never reached]
```

**Step 2: Error Path Analysis**
```
[Try Operation]
    ↓
[Success?]
    ↓
┌───┴───┐
↓       ↓
[Yes]   [No]
↓       ↓
[Next]  [Catch] → [Retry?] → [Fallback]
                     ↓
                  [Missing!] ← Issue
```

**Step 3: CORS/Network Validation**
- Check for "Failed to fetch" or CORS errors
- Verify retry logic exists in catch blocks
- Confirm fallback URLs or proxy usage
- Test error propagation to observers

**Step 4: Timing Analysis**
- Extract execution timestamps
- Identify race conditions (parallel operations)
- Check for missing Promise.all() or sequential awaits
- Verify timeout handling

```

## Response

```
No direct matches for "async function workflow" found.  
The error handling, network, and timing logic results are too large—I'll narrow the search to key files and focus on workflow, orchestrator, and step modules for detailed analysis next.
