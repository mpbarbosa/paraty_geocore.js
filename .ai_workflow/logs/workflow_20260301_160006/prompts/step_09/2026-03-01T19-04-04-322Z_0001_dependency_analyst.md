- Package Manager: npm
- Package Manager Version: N/A
- Scope: full-stack
- Modified Files: N/A
- Production Dependencies: 0
- Development Dependencies: 9
- Total Packages: 9

**Dependency Analysis Results:**
9 total (0 prod, 0 dev)

**Automated Findings:**
# Dependency Validation Report

## Summary

- **Language**: typescript
- **Total Dependencies**: 9
- **Production**: 0
- **Development**: 9

## Security Vulnerabilities

**Total Vulnerabilities**: 2

- ⚠️ **High**: 2

🚨 **Action Required**: Critical vulnerabilities need immediate attention!

## Outdated Packages

✅ All packages are up to date!

## 💡 Recommendations

1. Run `npm audit fix` to fix vulnerabilities
2. Review security advisories for manual fixes
3. Consider alternative packages if fixes unavailable



**Production Dependencies:**
none

**Development Dependencies:**
@types/jest, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, @typescript-eslint/parser, eslint, jest, markdownlint-cli, ts-jest, typedoc, typescript

**Security Audit Summary:**
2 total (0 critical, 2 high, 0 moderate, 0 low)

**Outdated Packages:**
none

**Tasks:**

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Review security audit results
   - Identify critical/high severity vulnerabilities
   - Assess exploitability and impact
   - Provide immediate remediation steps
   - Recommend long-term security strategy
   - Consider transitive dependencies

2. **Version Compatibility Analysis:**
   - Check for breaking changes in outdated packages
   - Identify version conflicts
   - Assess compatibility with language/runtime version
   - Review semver ranges (^, ~, exact versions)
   - Recommend version pinning strategy

3. **Dependency Tree Optimization:**
   - Identify unused dependencies
   - Detect duplicate packages in tree
   - Find opportunities to reduce bundle size
   - Recommend consolidation strategies
   - Suggest peer dependency resolution

4. **Environment Configuration Review:**
   - Validate language/runtime version compatibility
   - Check package manager version requirements
   - Review version specifications in package manifest
   - Assess development vs production dependencies
   - Recommend version management configuration

5. **Update Strategy Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize updates (security > bug fixes > features)
   - Create phased update plan
   - Identify breaking changes to watch
   - Recommend testing strategy for updates
   - Suggest automation (Dependabot, Renovate)


**Approach**: Analyze ONLY the dependencies and audit results explicitly listed above. Do not
invent package names, vulnerability counts, or version data not present in the context.

**Approach:**
Review the provided dependency lists, audit summary, and outdated packages.
Prioritize security vulnerabilities first, then version drift, then optimizations.

**Output:**
- Security vulnerability assessment with severity levels
- Immediate action items for critical vulnerabilities
- Safe update path for outdated packages
- Version compatibility matrix
- Dependency optimization recommendations
- Environment configuration best practices
- Automated dependency management setup

```

## Response

```
# Dependency & Security Assessment: paraty_geocore.js

## 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment

- **Findings:** 2 high-severity vulnerabilities (no criticals) in dev dependencies.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Run `npm audit fix` to auto-resolve if possible.
  - If unresolved, review advisories for manual patching or consider alternative packages.
  - Audit transitive dependencies for hidden risks.
- **Long-Term Strategy:** Enable automated security updates (Dependabot/Renovate), schedule regular audits, and monitor advisories for all dev tools.

## 2. Version Compatibility Analysis

- **Status:** All packages are up to date; no version conflicts or outdated packages.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure dev dependencies match your TypeScript and Node.js versions; check for breaking changes in major upgrades.
- **Version Pinning:** Use exact or caret (`^`) versions for dev dependencies to balance stability and updates; avoid loose ranges.

## 3. Dependency Tree Optimization

- **Unused/Duplicates:** No production dependencies; review dev dependencies for actual usage (e.g., remove unused linters or test frameworks).
- **Bundle Size:** Not a concern for dev-only packages.
- **Consolidation:** Prefer single versions of TypeScript-related packages; resolve peer dependency warnings during install.

## 4. Environment Configuration Review

- **Language/Runtime:** Confirm TypeScript and Node.js versions in `package.json` and CI configs.
- **Package Manager:** Specify minimum npm version in `engines` field for consistency.
- **Dev vs Prod:** All dependencies are dev-only; ensure production builds exclude dev tools.

## 5. Update Strategy Recommendations

- **Prioritization:** Address security vulnerabilities first, then bug fixes/features.
- **Phased Plan:** 
  1. Run `npm audit fix`
  2. Manually patch or replace unresolved vulnerabilities
  3. Test after each update
- **Testing:** Use CI to run tests after dependency changes.
- **Automation:** Enable Dependabot/Renovate for ongoing updates and security patches.
