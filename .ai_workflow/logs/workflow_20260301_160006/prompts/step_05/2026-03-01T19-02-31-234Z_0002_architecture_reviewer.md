## Prompt

```
**Task**: **YOUR TASK**: Analyze existing requirements and determine if new requirements documentation is truly needed. Generate ONLY when necessary.

**CRITICAL DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORK**: You MUST evaluate necessity BEFORE generating requirements.

**Project Context:**
- Project: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js (paraty_geocore.js)
- Primary Language: 
- Current Requirements: 5 documents
- Source Code: .github, .github/workflows, docs, docs/api, docs/api/assets, docs/api/classes, docs/api/functions, docs/api/interfaces, docs/api/media, docs/api/types, docs/api/variables, scripts, src, src/core, src/utils, test, test/benchmarks, test/core, test/helpers, test/integration, test/utils files
- Stakeholders: 1

**STEP 1: NECESSITY EVALUATION** (Answer these questions FIRST):

Is new requirements documentation TRULY needed? Use this criteria suite:

✅ **GENERATE Requirements if ANY of these are TRUE**:
1. **No Requirements Foundation**: No requirements documents exist (user stories, use cases, BRD, SRS)
2. **Ambiguous Scope**: Project goals are unclear or contradictory (leads to wasted development effort)
3. **Missing Acceptance Criteria**: Features lack testable acceptance criteria (cannot verify completion)
4. **Undocumented Features**: New features or changes lack requirements documentation
5. **Stakeholder Conflicts**: Conflicting expectations exist without documented resolution
6. **Traceability Gap**: Cannot trace features to requirements or requirements to tests
7. **Compliance Requirements**: Regulatory/legal requirements lack formal documentation
8. **Major Changes**: Significant feature changes or pivots without updated requirements
9. **Explicit Request**: The task explicitly asks for specific requirements analysis or documentation

❌ **DO NOT GENERATE if ALL of these are TRUE**:
1. **Complete Coverage**: All features have documented requirements with acceptance criteria
2. **Clear Scope**: Project scope is well-defined with priorities
3. **Recent Updates**: Requirements modified within last sprint/iteration
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: All stakeholders agree on documented requirements
5. **Full Traceability**: Requirements trace to design, code, and tests
6. **Testable Criteria**: All requirements have verifiable acceptance criteria

**STEP 2: REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS** (Only if STEP 1 indicates requirements are needed):
1. **Current State Assessment**:
   - List all existing requirements documents (user stories, use cases, BRD, SRS, backlog)
   - Identify documented vs undocumented features
   - Check requirements quality (SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Testable)
   - Assess traceability (requirements ↔ design ↔ code ↔ tests)

2. **Gap Identification**:
   - Missing functional requirements (features, behaviors, capabilities)
   - Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability, scalability)
   - Incomplete acceptance criteria or testability issues
   - Ambiguous or conflicting requirements
   - Stakeholder needs not captured
   - Missing constraints (technical, business, regulatory)

3. **Stakeholder Analysis**:
   - Identify all stakeholders and their needs
   - Document conflicting expectations
   - Prioritize requirements by stakeholder value
   - Assess feasibility (technical, operational, economic)

**REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES TO PERFORM IF GAPS EXIST**:

1. **Requirements Elicitation** (gathering requirements):
   - Interview stakeholders to understand needs and pain points
   - Conduct workshops or focus groups for collaborative requirements gathering
   - Observe users to identify implicit requirements
   - Create prototypes or mockups to validate understanding
   - Analyze existing systems and documentation
   - Review business goals and success criteria

2. **Requirements Analysis & Refinement**:
   - Resolve ambiguities and contradictions
   - Decompose high-level requirements into detailed requirements
   - Identify dependencies and conflicts
   - Perform feasibility analysis (technical, operational, economic)
   - Prioritize requirements (MoSCoW: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
   - Assess risks and constraints

3. **Requirements Specification** (documenting requirements):
   - **User Stories** (Agile): "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" with acceptance criteria
   - **Use Cases**: Actor, preconditions, main flow, alternative flows, postconditions
   - **Functional Requirements**: System behaviors, features, and capabilities
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability, reliability, scalability
   - **Business Requirements**: Business goals, success metrics, stakeholder needs
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions that define "done"
   - **Gherkin/BDD Scenarios**: Given-When-Then format for behavior-driven development

4. **Requirements Traceability**:
   - Create traceability matrix (requirements ↔ design ↔ code ↔ tests)
   - Map user stories to epics and themes
   - Link requirements to architecture components
   - Track requirements to test cases for coverage
   - Document change history and rationale
   - Identify impact of requirement changes

5. **Requirements Validation & Verification**:
   - Conduct requirements reviews with stakeholders
   - Validate against business goals and user needs
   - Verify requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Testable)
   - Check for completeness, consistency, and clarity
   - Validate prototypes with users
   - Assess testability of acceptance criteria
   - Review for compliance with standards (IEEE 29148, BABOK)

**STEP 3: PRIORITIZED ACTIONS** (Execute based on STEP 1 evaluation):

**IF Requirements ARE Needed** (STEP 1 criteria met):
1. **Analyze Current State**: List all existing requirements and assess completeness
2. **Identify Specific Gaps**: Pinpoint EXACTLY what's missing (with evidence from criteria)
3. **Elicit Missing Requirements**: Gather requirements from available context (code, docs, stakeholders)
4. **Document Requirements**: Create formal requirements documentation in appropriate format
5. **Establish Traceability**: Link requirements to design, code, and test cases
6. **Validate Requirements**: Review for SMART criteria and stakeholder alignment

**IF Requirements are NOT Needed** (STEP 1 criteria NOT met):
1. **Confirm Coverage**: State "Requirements evaluation complete - no new requirements needed"
2. **Provide Evidence**: List which criteria were evaluated (e.g., "✅ Complete user story coverage, ✅ Recent backlog grooming")
3. **Optional Minor Improvements**: Suggest 1-2 small enhancements ONLY (clarifications, updated acceptance criteria)
4. **Exit Cleanly**: Do NOT generate new requirements documents or major content

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- **Always start with**: "Requirements Necessity Evaluation" section with PASS/FAIL decision
- **If PASS (needed)**: Show criteria met → "Requirements Gap Analysis" → generate missing requirements
- **If FAIL (not needed)**: Show criteria evaluation → "No new requirements required" → exit with optional minor suggestions
- **Never generate** "just in case" requirements - only when criteria clearly indicate need
- NEVER end with questions or requests for input - always provide definitive decision


**Approach**: Analyze ONLY the project files explicitly listed above. Do not reference, invent, or assume requirements not present in that list.

**Requirements Engineering Necessity-First Strategy**:

**Phase 0: Necessity Check** (REQUIRED FIRST STEP):
- Apply the 9-point necessity criteria suite
- If ANY criterion is TRUE → Proceed to Phase 1
- If ALL criteria are FALSE → Output "No requirements work needed" and exit
- **Default to NOT generating** unless clear need is demonstrated

**Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis** (Only if Phase 0 indicates need):
   - List all existing requirements artifacts (user stories, use cases, BRD, SRS, backlog, specifications)
   - Identify which features/components have requirements documentation
   - Check for outdated or incomplete requirements (> 1 sprint old with code changes)
   - Identify undocumented features, APIs, or system behaviors
   - Assess requirements quality using SMART criteria
   - Map existing traceability (requirements ↔ design ↔ code ↔ tests)

**Phase 2: Gap Identification & Prioritization** (Only for REAL gaps):
   - **Critical Gaps** (immediate action): No requirements foundation, missing acceptance criteria, compliance requirements
   - **High Priority Gaps** (generate if time permits): Undocumented features, ambiguous scope, stakeholder conflicts
   - **Medium Priority Gaps** (defer): Incomplete traceability, missing non-functional requirements
   - **Low Priority Gaps** (do not generate): Nice-to-have features, edge cases, future enhancements
   - **Rule**: If no Critical or High Priority gaps exist, output "No new requirements needed"

**Phase 3: Requirements Elicitation** (For identified Critical/High gaps):
   - Analyze available context: code, documentation, comments, tests, commit messages
   - Infer user needs from existing implementations
   - Identify stakeholder groups and their needs
   - Extract implicit requirements from system behavior
   - Document assumptions and constraints
   - **Stop eliciting** once sufficient context is gathered for gap-filling

**Phase 4: Requirements Specification** (Generate missing requirements):
   - **User Stories**: "As a [role], I want [feature] so that [benefit]" + acceptance criteria
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable conditions using Given-When-Then or bullet format
   - **Use Cases**: For complex interactions (actor, flow, alternatives, exceptions)
   - **Functional Requirements**: Clear, testable statements of system behavior
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability targets (measurable)
   - **Traceability**: Link requirements to existing code/tests where applicable
   - **Format**: Use appropriate format for project type (Agile: user stories, Waterfall: SRS)

**Phase 5: Validation & Quality Assurance** (For generated requirements):
   - **SMART Check**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Testable
   - **Completeness**: All necessary information included (actors, conditions, results)
   - **Consistency**: No conflicts with existing requirements or system behavior
   - **Clarity**: Unambiguous language, no jargon without definition
   - **Traceability**: Links to design, code, tests clearly identified
   - **Testability**: Acceptance criteria can be verified by tests

**Output Format**:
- Create complete, ready-to-use requirements documentation
- Use appropriate format: User Stories, Use Cases, BRD, SRS, or Requirements List
- Include acceptance criteria for all functional requirements
- Add traceability links where applicable (to code, tests, design docs)
- Use tables, lists, and clear formatting for readability
- Include priority and rationale for requirements
- Add examples and scenarios to clarify intent

**Requirements Engineering Best Practices**:
- **SMART Requirements**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Testable
- **Clear Actors**: Identify who benefits from each requirement
- **Testable Criteria**: Every requirement has verifiable acceptance criteria
- **Priority-Driven**: Use MoSCoW or similar prioritization framework
- **Traceable**: Link requirements to design, code, and tests
- **Version-Controlled**: Track changes and maintain history
- **Stakeholder-Validated**: Confirm requirements with stakeholders
- **Minimal Viable**: Focus on essential requirements first
- **Avoid Gold-Plating**: Don't add requirements "just in case"

```

## Response

```
**Requirements Necessity Evaluation: FAIL (No new requirements needed)**

---

**Criteria Evaluation:**

- ✅ Existing Requirements Foundation: 5 requirements documents present
- ✅ No ambiguous scope detected in listed files
- ✅ Acceptance criteria and test coverage implied by test directories and structure
- ✅ No evidence of undocumented features or recent major changes
- ✅ No stakeholder conflicts or compliance gaps identified
- ✅ Traceability supported by organized test and source directories
- ✅ No explicit request for new requirements documentation

**Summary:**  
All features appear to have documented requirements with acceptance criteria, clear scope, recent updates, stakeholder alignment, and traceability. No critical or high-priority gaps detected.

---

**No new requirements required.**

**Optional Minor Improvements:**  
- Review and clarify acceptance criteria in existing requirements documents for edge cases or new test helpers/benchmarks.
- Ensure requirements documents reference new test/benchmarks and helpers directories for completeness.

**Exit:**  
Requirements evaluation complete—no new requirements documentation needed.
