**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Approach**: **Step 1: Async Chain Mapping**
Create execution flow with step numbers:
```
1. [Start] async function workflow()
2. await step1() → SUCCESS
3. await step2() → FAILED ← Break point
4. [Never reached]
```

**Step 2: Error Path Analysis**
```
[Try Operation]
    ↓
[Success?]
    ↓
┌───┴───┐
↓       ↓
[Yes]   [No]
↓       ↓
[Next]  [Catch] → [Retry?] → [Fallback]
                     ↓
                  [Missing!] ← Issue
```

**Step 3: CORS/Network Validation**
- Check for "Failed to fetch" or CORS errors
- Verify retry logic exists in catch blocks
- Confirm fallback URLs or proxy usage
- Test error propagation to observers

**Step 4: Timing Analysis**
- Extract execution timestamps
- Identify race conditions (parallel operations)
- Check for missing Promise.all() or sequential awaits
- Verify timeout handling

```

## Response

```
The codebase has extensive error handling for async chains, including catch blocks, retry logic, fallback paths, and timeout management in both implementation and tests. Timeout and fallback behaviors are validated in orchestrator, step, and AI modules, with tests confirming correct propagation and handling. No direct CORS/network errors found, but retry/fallback logic is present for network and AI failures.
