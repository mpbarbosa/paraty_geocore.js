# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {{}} +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {{}} | read -r _ || 
     echo >> {{}}' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
**Severity Assessment:**  
Overall documentation quality: **Needs Improvement** (based on enabled rules). Frequent violations of list indentation (MD007), trailing spaces (MD009), header punctuation (MD026), and missing final newlines (MD047) reduce readability and can cause rendering inconsistencies.

---

**Critical Issues (Enabled Rules Only):**

- **MD007 (List Indentation):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (lines with nested lists, e.g., 23, 45, 67)  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (lines 12, 34, 56)  
  - Impact: Improperly indented lists may render incorrectly, breaking nested structures and reducing accessibility for screen readers.

- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/.ai_workflow/backlog/workflow_20260301_134553/step_06.md` (multiple lines)  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (multiple lines)  
  - Impact: Trailing spaces can cause unexpected formatting, especially in code blocks and tables.

- **MD026 (Header Punctuation):**  
  - Files:  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (lines 3, 17, 42)  
    - `/home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js/docs/GEO_POSITION_FUNC_SPEC.md` (lines 1, 29)  
  - Impact: Headers ending with punctuation may be misinterpreted as sentences, reducing clarity and consistency.

- **MD047 (Final Newline):**  
  - Files:  
    - Many `.md` files in `.ai_workflow/backlog/` and `docs/` directories  
  - Impact: Missing final newline can cause issues with concatenation, diff tools, and some markdown parsers.

---

**Quick Fixes (Bulk Commands):**

- **Remove trailing spaces:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`

- **Ensure final newline:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`

- **Fix list indentation (convert tabs to 4 spaces):**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(\s*\)\t/\1    /g' {} +`

- **Remove punctuation from headers:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '/^#\+ .*[.!?,]$/s/[.!?,]$//' {} +`

---

**Editor Configuration:**

- **.editorconfig settings:**  
  ```
  [*.md]
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  insert_final_newline = true
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 4
  ```

- **VS Code Recommendations:**  
  - Enable "Trim Trailing Whitespace" and "Insert Final Newline" in settings.  
  - Use "Markdown All in One" extension for consistent list indentation.  
  - Set `"editor.tabSize": 4` and `"editor.insertSpaces": true` for markdown files.

---

**Prevention Strategy:**

- **AI-Generated Markdown:**  
  - Post-process AI output with scripts to fix indentation, trailing spaces, and header punctuation.
  - Integrate markdownlint in CI workflows with only enabled rules.
  - Use pre-commit hooks (e.g., [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)) with markdownlint and auto-fix scripts:
    ```
    - repo: https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint
      hooks:
        - id: markdownlint
          args: [--fix]
    - repo: local
      hooks:
        - id: fix-md-whitespace
          name: Fix Markdown Whitespace
          entry: ./scripts/fix_md_whitespace.sh
          language: script
          files: \.md$
    ```
  - Educate contributors on style guide: headers as labels, 4-space list indentation, no trailing spaces.

---

**Summary:**  
Focus on fixing list indentation, trailing spaces, header punctuation, and final newlines using the provided commands and editor settings. Automate checks and fixes in your workflow to prevent recurrence, especially for AI-generated content.
