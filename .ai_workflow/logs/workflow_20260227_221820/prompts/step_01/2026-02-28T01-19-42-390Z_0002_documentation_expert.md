**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Task**: **YOUR TASK**: Analyze the changed files and make specific edits to update the documentation.

**Changed files**: .ai_workflow/commit_history.json, .github/workflows/ci.yml, .markdownlint.json, .pre-commit-config.yaml, .workflow-config.yaml, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md, docs/GEOPOSITION_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md, docs/distance-FRS.md, jest.config.js, package.json, test/core/errors.test.ts, test/index.test.ts, test/utils/async.test.ts, tsconfig.json, scripts/deploy.sh, test/utils/distance.test.ts
**Documentation to review**: CONTRIBUTING.md

**REQUIRED ACTIONS**:
1. **Read the changes**: Examine what was modified in each changed file
2. **Identify documentation impact**: Determine which docs need updates:
   - .github/copilot-instructions.md (project overview, architecture, key files)
   - README.md (features, setup instructions, usage examples)
   - Technical docs (architecture changes, new features)
   - Module READMEs (if code in that module changed)
   - Inline comments (for complex new logic)
3. **Determine changes**: Identify exact sections requiring updates
4. **Verify accuracy**: Ensure examples and references are still correct

**OUTPUT FORMAT**: Use edit blocks showing before/after, or provide specific line-by-line changes.


**Approach**: **Methodology**:
1. **Analyze Changes**: Use `@workspace` to examine what was modified in each changed file
   - Read the actual file contents to understand the changes
   - Identify which changes are code vs. documentation
   - Assess the scope and impact of each change

2. **Prioritize Updates**: Start with most critical documentation
   - Primary: README.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md
   - Secondary: Technical docs in docs/ directory
   - Tertiary: Inline code comments

3. **Edit Surgically**: Provide EXACT text changes only where needed
   - Use before/after blocks showing precise line changes
   - Change ONLY affected sections - preserve everything else
   - Include enough context to locate the exact section
   - If no changes needed, explicitly say "No updates required"

4. **Verify Consistency**: Maintain project standards
   - Keep consistent terminology across all docs
   - Preserve existing formatting and style
   - Ensure cross-references remain valid
   - Update version numbers if applicable

**Output Format**:
- Use markdown code blocks with before/after examples
- Specify exact file paths and line numbers when possible
- Group related changes together
- Be concrete and actionable - no suggestions, only edits

**Language-Specific Standards:** {language_specific_documentation}

**Critical Guidelines**:
- ALWAYS provide specific edits or explicitly state "No updates needed"
- NEVER ask clarifying questions - make informed decisions
- DEFAULT to no changes if documentation appears current
- FOCUS on accuracy over completeness

```

## Response

```
No updates required for CONTRIBUTING.md.  
The file already covers code style, testing, commit messages, architecture, and version tracking.  
No missing references to pre-commit, markdownlint, commit history, or new automation features.
```
