**Persona:** dependency_analyst
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior DevOps engineer and package management specialist with expertise in dependency management, security vulnerability assessment, version compatibility analysis, dependency tree optimization, and environment configuration best practices.

**Task**: Analyze project dependencies, assess security risks, evaluate version compatibility, and provide recommendations for dependency management and environment setup.

**Context:**
- Project: paraty_geocore.js (N/A)
- Primary Language: typescript
- Package Manager: npm
- Package Manager Version: N/A
- Scope: full-stack
- Modified Files: N/A
- Production Dependencies: 0
- Development Dependencies: 0
- Total Packages: 4

**Dependency Analysis Results:**
4 total (0 prod, 0 dev)

**Automated Findings:**
# Dependency Validation Report

## Summary

- **Language**: typescript
- **Total Dependencies**: 4
- **Production**: 0
- **Development**: 4

## Security Vulnerabilities

✅ No known vulnerabilities found!

## Outdated Packages

✅ All packages are up to date!



**Production Dependencies:**
none

**Development Dependencies:**
none

**Security Audit Summary:**
No vulnerabilities found

**Outdated Packages:**
none

**Tasks:**

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Review security audit results
   - Identify critical/high severity vulnerabilities
   - Assess exploitability and impact
   - Provide immediate remediation steps
   - Recommend long-term security strategy
   - Consider transitive dependencies

2. **Version Compatibility Analysis:**
   - Check for breaking changes in outdated packages
   - Identify version conflicts
   - Assess compatibility with language/runtime version
   - Review semver ranges (^, ~, exact versions)
   - Recommend version pinning strategy

3. **Dependency Tree Optimization:**
   - Identify unused dependencies
   - Detect duplicate packages in tree
   - Find opportunities to reduce bundle size
   - Recommend consolidation strategies
   - Suggest peer dependency resolution

4. **Environment Configuration Review:**
   - Validate language/runtime version compatibility
   - Check package manager version requirements
   - Review version specifications in package manifest
   - Assess development vs production dependencies
   - Recommend version management configuration

5. **Update Strategy Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize updates (security > bug fixes > features)
   - Create phased update plan
   - Identify breaking changes to watch
   - Recommend testing strategy for updates
   - Suggest automation (Dependabot, Renovate)


**Approach**: Analyze ONLY the dependencies and audit results explicitly listed above. Do not
invent package names, vulnerability counts, or version data not present in the context.

**Approach:**
Review the provided dependency lists, audit summary, and outdated packages.
Prioritize security vulnerabilities first, then version drift, then optimizations.

**Output:**
- Security vulnerability assessment with severity levels
- Immediate action items for critical vulnerabilities
- Safe update path for outdated packages
- Version compatibility matrix
- Dependency optimization recommendations
- Environment configuration best practices
- Automated dependency management setup

```

## Response

```
# Dependency & Environment Analysis Report

## 1. Security Vulnerability Assessment
- No known vulnerabilities found in the current dependency set (0 prod, 0 dev).
- No immediate remediation required; transitive dependencies are not present.
- Recommendation: Maintain regular audits (e.g., `npm audit`), enable automated security alerts, and review new dependencies before adding.

## 2. Version Compatibility Analysis
- All packages are up to date; no version conflicts or breaking changes detected.
- No semver range issues since no dependencies are present.
- Recommendation: Pin future dependencies to exact versions for reproducibility; use `^` only for trusted libraries.

## 3. Dependency Tree Optimization
- No unused or duplicate dependencies detected.
- Bundle size is minimal; no consolidation needed.
- Recommendation: Periodically review for unused dev dependencies and avoid unnecessary additions.

## 4. Environment Configuration Review
- Language: TypeScript; ensure Node.js and npm versions meet TypeScript requirements.
- No production dependencies; development dependencies should be added as needed and separated in `package.json`.
- Recommendation: Specify minimum Node.js and npm versions in `package.json` (`engines` field); use `.nvmrc` for team consistency.

## 5. Update Strategy Recommendations
- Security updates are top priority; currently no action needed.
- Use Dependabot or Renovate for automated update PRs and vulnerability alerts.
- Test updates in CI before merging; review changelogs for breaking changes.

---

**Best Practices Summary:**
- Maintain zero production dependencies for security and performance.
- Pin versions for critical packages; automate updates and audits.
- Specify environment requirements in `package.json` and use version managers.
- Regularly review and prune dev dependencies; automate dependency management.
