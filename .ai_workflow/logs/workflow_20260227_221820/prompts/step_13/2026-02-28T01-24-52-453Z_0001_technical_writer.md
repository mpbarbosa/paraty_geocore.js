recommendations for improving documentation quality.

# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {{}} +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {{}} | read -r _ || 
     echo >> {{}}' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
Severity Assessment:
- **Overall Quality:** Good  
- Most markdown files comply with enabled rules, but some violations exist for trailing spaces (MD009), final newline (MD047), and occasional list indentation (MD007) and header punctuation (MD026).

Critical Issues:
- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces):**  
  - Example: `docs/README.md:45` (trailing whitespace)  
  - Impact: Causes unnecessary diffs, can affect code block rendering in some viewers.
- **MD047 (Final Newline):**  
  - Example: `CHANGELOG.md:EOF` (missing final newline)  
  - Impact: May cause issues with POSIX tools, some markdown parsers expect a newline.
- **MD007 (List Indentation):**  
  - Example: `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md:112` (nested list not indented with 4 spaces)  
  - Impact: Improper rendering of nested lists, accessibility issues for screen readers.
- **MD026 (Header Punctuation):**  
  - Example: `README.md:12` ("Project Overview.")  
  - Impact: Headers should be labels, not sentences; punctuation can confuse navigation tools.

Quick Fixes:
- **Remove trailing spaces:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- **Ensure final newline:**  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`
- **Fix list indentation (manual or with awk):**  
  `awk '/^  - /{print "    " $0; next} 1' file.md > tmp && mv tmp file.md`
- **Remove header punctuation:**  
  `sed -i '/^#/ s/[.!?,]$//' file.md`

Editor Configuration:
- Add to `.editorconfig`:
  ```
  [*.md]
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  insert_final_newline = true
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 4
  ```
- **VS Code Settings:**  
  - `"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true`  
  - `"files.insertFinalNewline": true`  
  - `"editor.tabSize": 4`  
  - `"editor.detectIndentation": false`

Prevention Strategy:
- **AI Generation:**  
  - Post-process markdown with linting scripts before commit.
  - Use markdownlint CLI in CI: `markdownlint '**/*.md' --config .mdlrc`
- **Pre-commit Hook:**  
  - Use `pre-commit` with `markdownlint` and `editorconfig-checker`.
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  - Add markdownlint and editorconfig-checker to CI pipeline for PR validation.
  - Document style guide in `docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md` and enforce via automation.

Summary:  
Address MD009, MD047, MD007, and MD026 violations with bulk commands and editor settings. Automate linting and formatting in pre-commit and CI workflows to maintain high documentation quality.
