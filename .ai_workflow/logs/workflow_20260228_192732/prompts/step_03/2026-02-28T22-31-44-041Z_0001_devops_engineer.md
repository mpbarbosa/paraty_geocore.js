**Persona:** devops_engineer
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior technical documentation specialist and DevOps documentation expert with expertise in shell script documentation, automation workflow documentation, and command-line tool reference guides.

**Task**: Perform comprehensive validation of shell script references and documentation quality for this project's automation scripts.

**Context:**
- Project: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js ()
- Primary Language: bash
- Shell Scripts Directory: ., scripts, src/scripts, src/workflow
- Total Scripts: 2
- Scope: 
- Modified Files: 0
- Issues Found in Phase 1: 0

**Phase 1 Automated Findings:**
Missing references: 0, Non-executable: 0, Undocumented: 0

**Available Scripts:**
cdn-delivery.sh
scripts/deploy.sh

**Tasks:**

1. **Script-to-Documentation Mapping:**
   - Verify every executable script in the project is documented in project README or script documentation
   - Check that documented scripts/executables actually exist at specified paths
   - Validate script descriptions match actual functionality
   - Ensure usage examples are accurate and complete

2. **Reference Accuracy:**
   - Validate command-line arguments in documentation match implementation
   - Check version numbers are consistent across documentation
   - Verify cross-references between scripts/modules are accurate
   - Validate file path references in code comments and documentation

3. **Documentation Completeness:**
   - Missing purpose/description for any scripts or executables
   - Missing usage examples or command syntax
   - Missing prerequisite or dependency information
   - Missing output/return value documentation

4. **Script Best Practices (Project-Specific):**
   - Executable permissions properly documented
   - Entry points (shebangs, main functions) mentioned in documentation where relevant
   - Environment variable requirements documented
   - Error handling and exit codes documented

5. **Integration Documentation:**
   - Workflow relationships between components documented
   - Execution order or dependencies clarified
   - Common use cases and examples provided
   - Troubleshooting guidance available

6. **DevOps Integration Documentation** (when applicable):
   - CI/CD pipeline references (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI)
   - Container/orchestration scripts (Docker, Kubernetes manifests, docker-compose)
   - Deployment automation documentation (deploy scripts, infrastructure provisioning)
   - Infrastructure-as-code script references (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation)
   - Monitoring/observability script documentation (health checks, metrics collection)
   - Build/release automation scripts (packaging, versioning, artifact management)

**Files to Analyze:**
- Project README.md and any module/component README files
- All executable files (shell scripts, Python scripts, Node.js scripts, etc.)
- .github/copilot-instructions.md (for automation/script references)
- Configuration files that define entry points or commands
- CI/CD configuration files (.github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, .circleci/)
- Container definitions (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Kubernetes manifests)
- Infrastructure-as-code scripts (*.tf, *.yml for Ansible, CloudFormation templates)
- Deployment/automation scripts (deploy/, scripts/, bin/ directories)


**Approach**: Analyze ONLY the scripts explicitly listed under "Available Scripts" above. Do not reference, invent, or assume the existence of any scripts not in that list.

**Output:**
- List of script reference issues with file:line locations
- Missing or incomplete script documentation
- Inconsistencies between code and documentation
- Recommendations for improving script documentation
- Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each issue
- Actionable remediation steps with examples

**Documentation Standards to Apply:**
- Clear and concise command syntax documentation
- Comprehensive usage examples for each script
- Accurate parameter and option descriptions
- Proper shell script documentation conventions
- Integration and workflow clarity

Please analyze the shell script references and provide a detailed validation report with specific recommendations for documentation improvements.

```

## Response

```
# Shell Script Documentation Validation Report

## Scripts Analyzed
- `cdn-delivery.sh`
- `scripts/deploy.sh`

## 1. Script-to-Documentation Mapping

**Findings:**
- Both scripts are referenced in the main `README.md` under "Release & Automation Scripts".
- Paths in documentation match actual file locations.
- Descriptions in README.md accurately reflect script functionality.
- Usage examples (`bash scripts/deploy.sh`, `bash cdn-delivery.sh`, `npm run cdn`) are present and correct.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 2. Reference Accuracy

**Findings:**
- Command-line arguments in documentation match script usage (`bash scripts/deploy.sh`, `bash cdn-delivery.sh`).
- Version numbers in README.md and scripts are consistent (`0.9.3-alpha`).
- Cross-references (e.g., `cdn-delivery.sh` called by `deploy.sh`) are accurate.
- File path references in comments and documentation are correct.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 3. Documentation Completeness

**Findings:**
- Purpose/description is present for both scripts in README.md and script headers.
- Usage examples and command syntax are provided.
- Prerequisites (Node.js, npm, git, curl) are documented.
- Output/return value documentation is present (console messages, committed artifacts, CDN URLs).

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## 4. Script Best Practices (Project-Specific)

**Findings:**
- Executable permissions are not explicitly documented (recommend adding a note if scripts are not executable by default).
- Shebangs (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) are present in both scripts and mentioned in script headers.
- Environment variable requirements are documented in script comments (e.g., `GITHUB_USER`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
- Error handling (`set -euo pipefail`) and exit codes are present in scripts, but not explicitly documented in README.md.

**Issues:**  
- **Low Priority:** Add a note in README.md about setting executable permissions if needed (`chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh`).
- **Medium Priority:** Document error handling and exit code conventions in README.md or script headers.

## 5. Integration Documentation

**Findings:**
- Workflow relationships (deploy script calls CDN script) are documented in README.md.
- Execution order and dependencies are clear.
- Common use cases and examples are provided.
- Troubleshooting guidance is not present.

**Issues:**  
- **Medium Priority:** Add a "Troubleshooting" section to README.md for common errors (e.g., missing dependencies, git tag conflicts).

## 6. DevOps Integration Documentation

**Findings:**
- No CI/CD pipeline, container, or infrastructure-as-code scripts found in the analyzed scope.
- Deployment automation is documented via `scripts/deploy.sh`.

**Issues:**  
- None found.

## Summary of Issues and Recommendations

| Issue                                                                 | Location                | Priority | Remediation Steps/Examples                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing note on executable permissions                                | README.md               | Low      | Add: `If not executable, run: chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh cdn-delivery.sh`                  |
| Error handling and exit codes not documented                          | README.md, script heads | Medium   | Add: "Scripts use set -euo pipefail; exit code 0 = success, nonzero = error"               |
| Missing troubleshooting guidance                                      | README.md               | Medium   | Add: "Troubleshooting" section with common errors (e.g., missing git, npm, curl, tag exists)|

---

## Example Remediation

**Add to README.md:**
```markdown
### Script Permissions
If scripts are not executable, run:
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh cdn-delivery.sh

### Error Handling
Both scripts use `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling. Exit code 0 indicates success; any nonzero exit code indicates an error.

### Troubleshooting
- **Missing dependencies:** Ensure Node.js, npm, git, and curl are installed.
- **Git tag already exists:** Delete or rename the tag before running deploy.
- **Permission denied:** Ensure scripts are executable (`chmod +x ...`).
```

## Overall Documentation Quality

**Status:** Good  
**Improvements Needed:** Minor (permissions, error handling, troubleshooting)  
**Priority:** Medium (for best practices and user experience)
