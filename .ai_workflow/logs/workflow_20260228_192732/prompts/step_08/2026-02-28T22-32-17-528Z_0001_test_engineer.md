# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T22:32:17.528Z
**Persona:** test_engineer
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior CI/CD engineer and test results analyst with expertise in test execution diagnostics, failure root cause analysis, code coverage interpretation, performance optimization, and continuous integration best practices.

**Task**: Analyze test execution results, diagnose failures, and provide actionable recommendations for improving test suite quality and CI/CD integration.

**Context:**
- Project: paraty_geocore.js (N/A)
- Primary Language: typescript
- Test Config: typescript via `jest --testPathPattern='test/(core|integration|utils|index)' --passWithNoTests`
- Exit Code: 127
- Results: 0/0 passed, 0 failed

**Test Execution Results:**
0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in 8ms

**Output:**
/bin/sh: 1: jest: not found

**Failed Tests:**
none

**Tasks:**

1. **Test Failure Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify why tests failed (assertion errors, runtime errors, timeouts)
   - Determine if failures are code bugs or test issues
   - Categorize failures (breaking changes, environment issues, flaky tests)
   - Provide specific fix recommendations for each failure
   - Priority level (Critical/High/Medium/Low) for each failure

2. **Coverage Gap Interpretation:**
   - Analyze coverage metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)
   - Identify which modules have low coverage
   - Determine if coverage meets 80% target
   - Recommend areas for additional test coverage
   - Prioritize coverage improvements

3. **Performance Bottleneck Detection:**
   - Identify slow-running tests (if timing data available)
   - Detect tests with heavy setup/teardown
   - Find tests that could be parallelized
   - Recommend test execution optimizations
   - Suggest mocking strategies for faster tests

4. **Flaky Test Analysis** (if multiple runs available):
   - Review test output for timing-related errors (timeouts, race conditions)
   - Identify tests that interact with external systems (filesystem, network, subprocesses)
   - Flag tests with random data generation without seeding
   - Note: True flaky test detection requires multiple runs; provide best-effort analysis from single execution
   - Recommend fixes for identified potential flaky patterns

5. **CI/CD Optimization Recommendations:**
   - Suggest test splitting strategies for CI
   - Recommend caching strategies
   - Propose pre-commit hook configurations
   - Suggest coverage thresholds for CI gates
   - Recommend test parallelization approaches


**Approach**: Analyze ONLY the test execution results explicitly provided above. Do not invent
test files, module names, or coverage metrics that are not in the provided context.

**Approach:**
Review the execution output, exit code, and pass/fail counts to diagnose issues.
Provide specific, actionable recommendations grounded in the supplied data.

**Output:**
- Root cause analysis for each failure with file:line:test references
- Specific code fixes or test modifications needed
- Coverage improvement action plan
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Flaky test remediation steps
- CI/CD integration best practices
- Priority-ordered action items
- Estimated effort for each fix

Please provide a comprehensive test results analysis with specific, actionable recommendations.

```

## Response

```
**Test Results Analysis & Recommendations**

---

### 1. Test Failure Root Cause Analysis

- **Root Cause:** No tests executed; Jest not found (`/bin/sh: 1: jest: not found`).  
- **Failure Type:** Environment/configuration issue (not code/test bugs).  
- **Priority:** **Critical** — Test runner missing, blocking all test execution.

**Action:**  
- Install Jest: `npm install --save-dev jest` (or `yarn add --dev jest`).  
- Ensure `node_modules/.bin` is in PATH or use `npx jest ...` for test runs.  
- Verify Jest is listed in `devDependencies` in `package.json`.

---

### 2. Coverage Gap Interpretation

- **Root Cause:** No coverage data; 0 tests executed.  
- **Action:**  
  - After fixing Jest installation, run tests with coverage: `jest --coverage`.  
  - Review coverage report for modules below 80% and prioritize adding tests for uncovered statements, branches, and functions.

---

### 3. Performance Bottleneck Detection

- **Root Cause:** No timing data; no tests executed.  
- **Action:**  
  - After restoring test execution, enable Jest timing output (`--detectOpenHandles`, `--runInBand` for diagnostics).  
  - Identify slow tests and optimize setup/teardown, use mocking, and parallelize where possible.

---

### 4. Flaky Test Analysis

- **Root Cause:** No test runs; cannot assess flakiness.  
- **Action:**  
  - After restoring test execution, run tests multiple times and monitor for inconsistent results.  
  - Seed random data, mock external dependencies, and isolate tests to reduce flakiness.

---

### 5. CI/CD Optimization Recommendations

- **Test Splitting:** Use Jest's `--testPathPattern` to split tests by type (core, integration, utils, index) for parallel CI jobs.
- **Caching:** Cache `node_modules` and Jest coverage output in CI for faster builds.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Add `lint` and `test` hooks via Husky or similar tools.
- **Coverage Gates:** Set CI coverage threshold to 80% minimum.
- **Parallelization:** Use Jest's default parallel runner; split test suites for large projects.

---

### Priority-Ordered Action Items

1. **[Critical]** Install Jest and verify test runner configuration.
2. **[Critical]** Re-run tests and confirm execution; address any new failures.
3. **[High]** Enable coverage reporting; identify and address coverage gaps.
4. **[Medium]** Analyze test timings; optimize slow tests and parallelize.
5. **[Medium]** Run tests multiple times to detect flakiness; apply fixes.
6. **[Medium]** Implement CI/CD best practices: caching, hooks, coverage gates, parallelization.

---

### Estimated Effort

- Jest installation/configuration: **<30 min**
- Test execution/diagnostics: **1-2 hrs**
- Coverage analysis/improvement: **2-4 hrs** (depends on gaps)
- Performance/flaky test optimization: **2-4 hrs**
- CI/CD integration: **1-2 hrs**

---

**Summary:**  
No tests ran due to missing Jest. Immediate action: install Jest, rerun tests, and address any subsequent issues. All other analysis (coverage, performance, flakiness) is blocked until test execution is restored.
