# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
### 1. Severity Assessment

**Overall Quality:** Good  
Most markdown files comply with enabled rules, but recurring minor issues (trailing spaces, final newline, inconsistent list indentation, header punctuation) reduce quality from Excellent.

---

### 2. Critical Issues

**MD007 (List Indentation):**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 45, 67, 120)  
  - `README.md` (lines 88, 102)  
  - `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` (lines 34, 56)  
- **Impact:** Improper indentation breaks nested list rendering, causing confusion for screen readers and inconsistent formatting.

**MD009 (Trailing Spaces):**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 12, 78, 143)  
  - `README.md` (lines 21, 44, 99)  
  - `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` (lines 17, 38, 72)  
- **Impact:** Trailing spaces can cause unexpected line breaks and visual artifacts in rendered markdown.

**MD026 (Header Punctuation):**  
- Files:  
  - `README.md` (lines 3, 50)  
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 7, 60)  
- **Impact:** Headers ending with punctuation reduce clarity and may be misinterpreted by markdown parsers or accessibility tools.

**MD047 (Final Newline):**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`  
  - `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md`  
- **Impact:** Missing final newline can cause issues with concatenation, diff tools, and some markdown renderers.

---

### 3. Quick Fixes

**Remove trailing spaces:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +
```

**Ensure final newline:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;
```

**Fix list indentation (4 spaces for nested):**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\([ ]*\)[*+-] /\1    - /' {} +
```
*(Review before bulk apply; may need manual adjustment for complex lists.)*

**Remove header punctuation:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(##\+ .*\)[.!?,]$/\1/' {} +
```

---

### 4. Editor Configuration

**.editorconfig:**
```
[*]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

**VS Code Settings:**
```json
"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true,
"files.insertFinalNewline": true,
"editor.tabSize": 4,
"[markdown]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

---

### 5. Prevention Strategy

- **AI Generation:**  
  - Post-process markdown output with linting scripts before commit.
  - Use markdown formatters (e.g., Prettier) with strict settings for enabled rules.
- **Pre-commit Hook:**  
  - Add to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
    ```bash
    npx markdownlint-cli '**/*.md' --config .mdlrc
    ```
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  - Integrate markdownlint in CI (GitHub Actions) to block merges with enabled rule violations.
  - Schedule nightly linting jobs for documentation.

---

**Summary:**  
Address MD007, MD009, MD026, and MD047 violations with the above commands and editor settings. Automate linting in pre-commit and CI workflows to maintain high documentation quality.
