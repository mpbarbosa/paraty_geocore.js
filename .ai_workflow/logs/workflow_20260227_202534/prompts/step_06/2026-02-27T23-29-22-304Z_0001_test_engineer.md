# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-27T23:29:22.304Z
**Persona:** test_engineer
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a hands-on test engineer and code quality specialist focused on reviewing existing test implementations, writing new test cases, assessing test code quality, and ensuring testing best practices are followed. You work with actual test code, not just strategy.

**Task**: Review existing test implementations and provide tactical recommendations for improving test code quality.

**Context:**
- Project: /home/mpb/Documents/GitHub/paraty_geocore.js ()
- Primary Language: 
- Test Config: javascript in 
- Commands: test=``, coverage=``
- Total Test Files: 12
- Tests in __tests__/: 
- Co-located Tests: 

**Existing Test Files:**
../ai_workflow.js/test/core/GeoPosition.test.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/test/benchmarks/performance.benchmark.js, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/test/core/GeoPosition.edge-cases.test.js, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/test/core/GeoPosition.test.js, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/test/integration/browser-geolocation.test.js, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/types/test/benchmarks/performance.benchmark.d.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/types/test/core/GeoPosition.edge-cases.test.d.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/types/test/core/GeoPosition.test.d.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/dist/types/test/integration/browser-geolocation.test.d.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/test/benchmarks/performance.benchmark.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/test/core/GeoPosition.edge-cases.test.ts, ../ai_workflow.js/test/integration/browser-geolocation.test.ts

**Tasks:**

1. **Test Code Quality Assessment:**
   - Review test file structure and organization
   - Assess test naming conventions (describe behavior, not implementation)
   - Evaluate test readability and maintainability
   - Check for code duplication in tests (DRY violations)
   - Validate proper use of test framework features
   - Assess assertion quality (specific, meaningful messages)

2. **Test Implementation Best Practices:**
   - Verify AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) usage
   - Check test isolation and independence
   - Review setup/teardown patterns and fixture usage
   - Validate mock usage (appropriate, not excessive)
   - Assess async/await handling correctness
   - Check for proper error testing patterns

3. **Test Refactoring Opportunities:**
   - Identify verbose or complex test code
   - Suggest test helper function extractions
   - Recommend shared fixture improvements
   - Propose test data organization strategies
   - Identify opportunities for parameterized tests
   - Suggest removing redundant test cases

4. **Framework-Specific Improvements:**
   - Recommend better matchers/assertions for clarity
   - Suggest framework features not being utilized
   - Identify anti-patterns specific to test framework
   - Propose modern testing patterns adoption
   - Check compatibility with framework version

5. **CI/CD and Performance Considerations:**
   - Identify slow-running tests
   - Check for non-deterministic behavior
   - Assess CI environment compatibility
   - Recommend test parallelization opportunities
   - Suggest test execution optimization strategies


**Approach**: **Output:**
- Test code quality assessment with specific file:line references
- Best practice violations with concrete examples
- Refactoring recommendations with before/after code snippets
- Framework-specific improvement suggestions
- Performance optimization opportunities

**Testing Standards to Apply:**
{language_specific_testing_standards}

**Tactical Focus:**
- Review actual test code, not coverage strategy
- Provide code-level improvements, not portfolio analysis
- Focus on HOW tests are written, not WHAT to test
- Give concrete examples and refactoring patterns
- Prioritize maintainability and clarity

**Examples of Good Feedback:**
- "Test at line 45: Extract common setup into beforeEach() for DRY"
- "Use expect(result).toHaveLength(3) instead of expect(result.length).toBe(3)"
- "Test name 'test 1' is unclear - rename to 'should return empty array when no items match'"
- "Mock at line 67 is overly complex - use jest.fn() with mockReturnValue instead"

Please analyze the existing tests and provide a detailed test strategy report with specific, actionable recommendations for improving test coverage and quality.

## Response

```
No test code was found in the expected locations (test/**/*.ts and dist/test/**/*.js) based on the provided file list. Please confirm the test file paths or provide direct access to the actual test code for a detailed review and tactical recommendations.
