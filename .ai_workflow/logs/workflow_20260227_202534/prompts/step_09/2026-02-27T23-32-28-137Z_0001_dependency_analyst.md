**Persona:** dependency_analyst
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior DevOps engineer and package management specialist with expertise in dependency management, security vulnerability assessment, version compatibility analysis, dependency tree optimization, and environment configuration best practices.

**Task**: Analyze project dependencies, assess security risks, evaluate version compatibility, and provide recommendations for dependency management and environment setup.

**Context:**
- Project:  ()
- Primary Language: 
- Package Manager: 
- Package Manager Version: 
- Scope: 
- Modified Files: 
- Production Dependencies: 
- Development Dependencies: 
- Total Packages: 4

**Dependency Analysis Results:**


**Automated Findings:**


**Production Dependencies:**
0

**Development Dependencies:**
0

**Security Audit Summary:**


**Outdated Packages:**


**Tasks:**

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:**
   - Review security audit results
   - Identify critical/high severity vulnerabilities
   - Assess exploitability and impact
   - Provide immediate remediation steps
   - Recommend long-term security strategy
   - Consider transitive dependencies

2. **Version Compatibility Analysis:**
   - Check for breaking changes in outdated packages
   - Identify version conflicts
   - Assess compatibility with language/runtime version
   - Review semver ranges (^, ~, exact versions)
   - Recommend version pinning strategy

3. **Dependency Tree Optimization:**
   - Identify unused dependencies
   - Detect duplicate packages in tree
   - Find opportunities to reduce bundle size
   - Recommend consolidation strategies
   - Suggest peer dependency resolution

4. **Environment Configuration Review:**
   - Validate language/runtime version compatibility
   - Check package manager version requirements
   - Review version specifications in package manifest
   - Assess development vs production dependencies
   - Recommend version management configuration

5. **Update Strategy Recommendations:**
   - Prioritize updates (security > bug fixes > features)
   - Create phased update plan
   - Identify breaking changes to watch
   - Recommend testing strategy for updates
   - Suggest automation (Dependabot, Renovate)


**Approach**: **Output:**
- Security vulnerability assessment with severity levels
- Immediate action items for critical vulnerabilities
- Safe update path for outdated packages
- Version compatibility matrix
- Dependency optimization recommendations
- Environment configuration best practices
- Automated dependency management setup

```

## Response

```
**Security Vulnerability Assessment:**  
No production or development dependencies detected; no vulnerabilities found. No immediate remediation required. For future, enable automated security audits (e.g., npm audit, Snyk) and review transitive dependencies regularly.

**Version Compatibility Analysis:**  
No outdated packages or version conflicts present. Ensure future dependencies use semver ranges (`^` for minor/patch, exact for critical) and pin versions for reproducible builds.

**Dependency Tree Optimization:**  
With zero dependencies, no unused or duplicate packages exist. As dependencies are added, periodically run `npm prune` and use tools like `depcheck` to identify unused packages.

**Environment Configuration Review:**  
Specify Node.js and npm version requirements in `package.json` (`"engines"` field) for consistency. Separate production and development dependencies using `--save` and `--save-dev` flags.

**Update Strategy Recommendations:**  
Set up Dependabot or Renovate for automated updates and security patching. Prioritize security updates, test with CI before deploying, and document update procedures in CONTRIBUTING.md.
