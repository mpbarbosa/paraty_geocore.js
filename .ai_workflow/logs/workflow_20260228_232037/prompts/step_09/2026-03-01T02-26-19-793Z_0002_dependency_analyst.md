**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Task**: **YOUR TASK**: Create, review, or update package.json to accurately reflect project dependencies, scripts, and metadata following JavaScript ecosystem best practices.

**Project Context:**
- Project: paraty_geocore.js (N/A)
- Project Kind: N/A
- Language: typescript
- Package Manager: npm
- Test Framework: jest
- Test Command: npm test
- Lint Command: eslint .
- Modified Files: N/A

**ANALYSIS PHASE**: Evaluate the package.json across the following dimensions:
1. **Dependencies**: Are all required libraries listed? Are versions appropriate (not too loose, not unnecessarily pinned)?
2. **DevDependencies**: Are build tools, test runners, and linters correctly placed under devDependencies?
3. **Scripts**: Do script aliases exist for start, test, build, lint, and format? Are they correct and runnable?
4. **Metadata**: Are name, version, description, license, main/exports, and author fields complete and accurate?
5. **Security**: Are there known vulnerabilities? Is the lockfile in sync? Are dependency ranges safe?
6. **Compatibility**: Are engines, peerDependencies, and browserslist fields set when needed?

**REQUIRED ACTIONS**:

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - List runtime dependencies in "dependencies" (required at runtime)
   - List build/test/tooling packages in "devDependencies" (not needed in production)
   - Apply semver ranges: use `^` (compatible) for stable libraries, `~` (patch-only) for sensitive libs, exact for critical pinning
   - Flag outdated or deprecated packages with recommended replacements
   - Identify missing dependencies that are imported but not declared
   - Remove unused dependencies that are declared but never imported

2. **Script Authoring**:
   - Define `start` script to launch the application (e.g., `node src/index.js`)
   - Define `test` script using the project's test framework (e.g., `jest`, `mocha`, `vitest`)
   - Define `build` script for compiled/bundled projects (e.g., `tsc`, `webpack`, `vite build`)
   - Define `lint` script for static analysis (e.g., `eslint .`, `eslint src --ext .js,.ts`)
   - Define `format` script for code formatting (e.g., `prettier --write .`)
   - Add pre/post hooks (e.g., `pretest`, `prebuild`) where appropriate
   - Use `cross-env` for environment variables that must work on Windows and Unix

3. **Project Metadata**:
   - `name`: lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces (e.g., `my-app`)
   - `version`: valid semver (e.g., `1.0.2`), no `v` prefix
   - `description`: concise one-line summary
   - `license`: valid SPDX identifier (e.g., `MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `UNLICENSED`)
   - `main`: CommonJS entry point (e.g., `dist/index.js`)
   - `module`: ESM entry point when dual CJS/ESM is supported
   - `exports`: modern conditional exports map for Node.js subpath exports
   - `repository`, `homepage`, `bugs`: link to source control and issue tracker
   - `keywords`: relevant terms to improve discoverability on npm registry

4. **Security & Integrity**:
   - Run `npm audit` and remediate high/critical vulnerabilities
   - Use `overrides` (npm v8+) or `resolutions` (yarn) to patch transitive vulnerabilities
   - Commit the lockfile (`package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml`) to source control
   - Set `"private": true` to prevent accidental publish for application packages

5. **Compatibility & Environment**:
   - Set `engines.node` to specify the minimum required Node.js version (e.g., `">=18.0.0"`)
   - Declare `peerDependencies` for libraries that expect the host project to provide a dependency
   - Add `browserslist` for front-end projects to guide transpiler and CSS autoprefixer targets
   - Configure `type: "module"` for projects using native ESM, `"commonjs"` (default) otherwise

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- Provide the complete updated package.json as a JSON code block
- List each change made with a brief justification (e.g., "Added `jest` to devDependencies — test runner used in `npm test`")
- Flag security issues with severity level (critical, high, moderate, low)
- Note any breaking changes that require developer action (e.g., Node.js version upgrade)


**Approach**: **JavaScript Developer Methodology**:

1. **Dependency Classification**:
   - Runtime (dependencies): Express, React, lodash, axios — needed to run the app
   - Dev-only (devDependencies): Jest, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Webpack — build/test tooling only
   - Peer (peerDependencies): React for a React component library — host provides it
   - Optional (optionalDependencies): Platform-specific native modules

2. **Semver Version Strategy**:
   - `^1.2.3` (caret): accepts `>=1.2.3 <2.0.0` — safe for most libraries
   - `~1.2.3` (tilde): accepts `>=1.2.3 <1.3.0` — conservative, patch updates only
   - `1.2.3` (exact): pin when upstream has frequent breaking patch releases
   - Avoid `*` or `latest` — introduces unpredictable builds

3. **Script Composition Patterns**:
   - Chain commands with `&&` for sequential tasks: `"build": "tsc && cp -r assets dist/"`
   - Use `npm-run-all` or `concurrently` for parallel script execution
   - Prefix internal scripts with `_` or namespace with `:` (e.g., `lint:js`, `lint:css`)
   - Use `--` to pass CLI flags from npm scripts: `"test:watch": "jest --watch"`

4. **Monorepo / Workspaces**:
   - Define `workspaces` array in root package.json: `["packages/*", "apps/*"]`
   - Hoist shared devDependencies to root; keep package-specific runtime deps local
   - Use `--workspace` flag or Turborepo/Nx for cross-package script orchestration

5. **Security Governance**:
   - Run `npm audit --audit-level=high` in CI to block builds on high/critical issues
   - Use Dependabot or Renovate for automated dependency update PRs
   - Review supply-chain integrity with `npm pack --dry-run` before publishing

**Quality Checklist**:
- ✅ `name` is lowercase, hyphenated, and unique (or scoped for private registries)
- ✅ `version` follows semver with no `v` prefix
- ✅ `description` and `license` fields are populated
- ✅ `main` / `exports` entry points resolve to actual files
- ✅ All imported packages are declared in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`
- ✅ No runtime packages accidentally placed in `devDependencies`
- ✅ `npm test` and `npm start` scripts are defined and functional
- ✅ `npm audit` shows no high or critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ Lockfile is committed and in sync with package.json
- ✅ `engines.node` is set to the minimum supported Node.js LTS version
- ✅ `"private": true` set for application packages (non-published)
- ✅ ESM/CJS `type` field is correctly set for the module system in use

**JavaScript Package Best Practices**:
- Keep devDependencies out of production image layers (use `npm ci --omit=dev`)
- Prefer well-maintained packages with active release cadence and security track record
- Audit transitive dependencies — a vulnerability in a nested dep is still your vulnerability
- Version-lock exact versions in CI with `npm ci` (uses lockfile, never updates it)
- Document non-obvious script commands with a comment in README, not inline package.json
