recommendations for improving documentation quality.

# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {{}} +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {{}} | read -r _ || 
     echo >> {{}}' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
Severity Assessment  
Overall documentation quality: **Good**. Most markdown files comply with enabled rules, but several minor issues (trailing spaces, inconsistent list indentation, header punctuation, missing final newline) reduce polish and may affect rendering in some viewers.

Critical Issues  
- **MD007 (List Indentation)**:  
  - Files: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 45, 67), `README.md` (lines 120-125)  
  - Impact: Improperly nested lists may render incorrectly, especially in strict markdown viewers or screen readers.
- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces)**:  
  - Files: `docs/EXAMPLES.md` (lines 32, 54, 78), `CHANGELOG.md` (lines 101, 202)  
  - Impact: Trailing spaces can cause unexpected line breaks and accessibility issues for screen readers.
- **MD026 (Header Punctuation)**:  
  - Files: `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` (lines 12, 34), `docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` (lines 8, 56)  
  - Impact: Headers ending with punctuation may be misinterpreted as sentences, reducing clarity and accessibility.
- **MD047 (Final Newline)**:  
  - Files: `docs/REFERENCE.md`, `docs/ERROR_CODES.md`, `docs/EXAMPLES.md`  
  - Impact: Missing final newline can cause issues with concatenation, diff tools, and some markdown parsers.

Quick Fixes  
- Remove trailing spaces:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- Ensure final newline:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;`
- Fix list indentation (convert tabs to 4 spaces):  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\t/    /' {} +`
- Remove header punctuation:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '/^#.*[.!?,]$/s/[.!?,]$//' {} +`

Editor Configuration  
Add to `.editorconfig`:
```
[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```
VS Code settings:
- `"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true`
- `"files.insertFinalNewline": true"`
- `"editor.tabSize": 4`
- `"editor.detectIndentation": false`

Prevention Strategy  
- Enable markdown linting in CI (e.g., `markdownlint-cli` with `.mdlrc`)
- Add pre-commit hook:  
  `npx lint-staged` with `"*.md": ["markdownlint --fix"]`
- For AI-generated markdown, post-process with scripts above and enforce style guide in prompt templates.
- Automate linting in PR workflows to block merges with enabled rule violations.

Summary:  
Addressing these issues with bulk commands, editor settings, and automated hooks will ensure consistent, accessible, and high-quality markdown documentation.
