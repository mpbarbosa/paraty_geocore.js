# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
Severity Assessment:
- Overall quality: **Good**. Most markdown files comply with enabled rules, but violations of MD007, MD009, MD026, and MD047 are present and easily fixable.

Critical Issues:
- **MD007 (List Indentation)**: Incorrect nested list indentation in several files (e.g., `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` lines 45-52, `README.md` lines 120-130). This can cause rendering inconsistencies in some markdown viewers.
- **MD009 (Trailing Spaces)**: Trailing whitespace found in files like `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` (lines 88, 102) and `CHANGELOG.md` (lines 210, 215). Trailing spaces may affect copy-paste and cause unnecessary diffs.
- **MD026 (Header Punctuation)**: Headers ending with punctuation in `docs/PHASE_D_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (lines 12, 34) and `docs/examples/basic/README.md` (lines 5, 18). This impacts accessibility and violates style conventions.
- **MD047 (Final Newline)**: Missing final newline in `docs/reference/ERROR_CODES.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. This can cause issues with some tools and editors.

Quick Fixes:
- Trailing spaces:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +`
- Final newline:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 {} | read -r _ || echo >> {}' \;`
- List indentation (4 spaces):  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\( *\)-/\1    -/' {} +`
- Header punctuation:  
  `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(##\+ .*\)[.!?,]$/\1/' {} +`

Editor Configuration:
- Add to `.editorconfig`:
  ```
  [*.md]
  trim_trailing_whitespace = true
  insert_final_newline = true
  indent_style = space
  indent_size = 4
  ```
- VS Code:  
  - Enable "Trim Trailing Whitespace" and "Insert Final Newline" in settings.
  - Use markdownlint extension with custom `.markdownlint.json` for enabled rules.

Prevention Strategy:
- AI-generated markdown:  
  - Post-process with linting scripts before commit.
  - Integrate markdownlint in CI workflows.
- Pre-commit hook (example with `pre-commit`):
  ```yaml
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
  ```
- Automate linting in GitHub Actions to block PRs with enabled rule violations.

**Summary:**  
Fix enabled rule violations with bulk commands, enforce formatting via `.editorconfig` and editor settings, and automate linting in pre-commit and CI workflows to maintain high markdown quality.
