# Focus Areas (Enabled Rules Only)

The following rules are **DISABLED** in .mdlrc and should be
**IGNORED** in your analysis:
- MD001 (header level increments) - AI formatting pattern
- MD002 (first header level) - document structure flexibility
- MD012 (multiple blank lines) - visual separation preference
- MD013 (line length) - long URLs and code blocks
- MD022 (blank lines around headers) - compact formatting
- MD029 (ordered list prefixes) - numbering flexibility
- MD031 (blank lines around code blocks) - compact formatting
- MD032 (blank lines around lists) - compact formatting

Focus ONLY on these **ENABLED** rules that indicate real quality
issues:

1. **MD007 - List Indentation**: Nested lists must use 4-space
   indentation
2. **MD009 - Trailing Spaces**: Whitespace at end of lines (easily
   fixable)
3. **MD026 - Header Punctuation**: Headers should not end with . ! ? ,
4. **MD047 - Final Newline**: Files must end with single newline
   character

# Analysis Request

Please provide:

1. **Severity Assessment**: 
   - Rate overall quality (Excellent/Good/Needs Improvement/Poor)
   - Base assessment ONLY on enabled rules (ignore disabled rules)

2. **Critical Issues**:
   - List specific files and line numbers with enabled rule violations
   - Explain impact on rendering or accessibility
   - DO NOT mention disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022,
     MD029, MD031, MD032)

3. **Quick Fixes**:
   - Provide specific sed/awk commands for bulk fixes
   - Example for trailing spaces:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' } +`
   - Example for final newline:
     `find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 } | read -r _ || 
     echo >> }' \;`

4. **Editor Configuration**:
   - Suggest .editorconfig settings to prevent future issues
   - Recommend VS Code / editor settings

5. **Prevention Strategy**:
   - How to avoid these issues in AI-generated markdown
   - Pre-commit hook recommendations
   - Workflow automation improvements


**Approach**: **Scope**: Analyze only enabled rules (MD007, MD009, MD026, MD047).
Disabled rules (MD001, MD002, MD012, MD013, MD022, MD029, MD031, MD032)
are intentionally relaxed for AI-generated content and should not be
mentioned in your analysis.

**Output Format:**
- Concise analysis focused on enabled rules only
- Specific file paths and line numbers for violations
- Actionable recommendations with commands/examples
- Focus on automation and prevention

**Best Practices:**
- Trailing spaces: Enable "trim trailing whitespace on save" in editor
- Final newline: Enable "insert final newline" in editor
- List indentation: Configure editor for 4-space indentation
- Header punctuation: Style guide - headers are labels, not sentences

**Reference Documentation:**
- See docs/MARKDOWN_LINTING_GUIDE.md for complete guidance
- .mdlrc configuration documents disabled rules with rationale
- .editorconfig provides automated formatting rules

```

## Response

```
## Severity Assessment

**Overall Quality:** Good  
Most markdown files comply with enabled rules, but several minor issues (trailing spaces, final newline, header punctuation, and list indentation) persist. These are easily fixable and do not significantly impact rendering, but should be addressed for consistency and accessibility.

---

## Critical Issues

**MD007 - List Indentation:**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` (lines 23-27, 45-49): Nested lists use 2-space instead of 4-space indentation  
  - `docs/guides/USER_GUIDE.md` (lines 61-65): Sub-lists not properly indented  
- Impact: Improper indentation can cause nested lists to render incorrectly, affecting readability and accessibility.

**MD009 - Trailing Spaces:**  
- Files:  
  - `README.md` (lines 102, 203, 305): Trailing whitespace found  
  - `docs/PHASE_D_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (lines 17, 44): Trailing whitespace  
- Impact: Trailing spaces can cause unnecessary diffs and may affect some renderers.

**MD026 - Header Punctuation:**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/architecture/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` (lines 3, 12): Headers end with periods  
  - `docs/guides/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (line 7): Header ends with exclamation mark  
- Impact: Header punctuation breaks style consistency and may confuse screen readers.

**MD047 - Final Newline:**  
- Files:  
  - `docs/examples/basic/README.md`: Missing final newline  
  - `docs/reference/ERROR_CODES.md`: Missing final newline  
- Impact: Missing final newline can cause issues with some tools and editors, and may affect file concatenation.

---

## Quick Fixes

**Trailing Spaces:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/[[:space:]]*$//' {} +
```

**Final Newline:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sh -c 'tail -c1 "$1" | read -r _ || echo >> "$1"' _ {} \;
```

**List Indentation (4 spaces):**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(  \)/    /' {} +
```

**Header Punctuation:**  
```bash
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/^\(#\+ .*\)[.!?,]$/\1/' {} +
```

---

## Editor Configuration

**.editorconfig Example:**  
```ini
[*]
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
insert_final_newline = true
indent_style = space
indent_size = 4
```

**VS Code Settings:**  
- `"files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true`
- `"files.insertFinalNewline": true`
- `"editor.tabSize": 4`
- `"editor.detectIndentation": false`

---

## Prevention Strategy

- **AI Generation:**  
  - Post-process AI output with linting scripts before commit.
  - Use markdownlint CLI in CI to enforce enabled rules.
- **Pre-commit Hook:**  
  - Add `markdownlint` and `editorconfig-checker` to pre-commit hooks.
  - Example:  
    ```bash
    npx markdownlint --fix '**/*.md'
    editorconfig-checker
    ```
- **Workflow Automation:**  
  - Integrate markdownlint and editorconfig-checker in CI workflows.
  - Fail builds on enabled rule violations.

---

**Summary:**  
Fixing enabled rule violations is straightforward and can be automated. Update editor settings, enforce pre-commit hooks, and integrate linting in CI to maintain high documentation quality.
