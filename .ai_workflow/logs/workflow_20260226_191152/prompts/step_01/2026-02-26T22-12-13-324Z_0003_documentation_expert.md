# Prompt Log

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26T22:12:13.324Z
**Persona:** documentation_expert
**Model:** gpt-4.1

## Prompt

```
**Role**: You are a senior technical documentation specialist with expertise in software architecture documentation, API documentation, and developer experience (DX) optimization.

**Critical Behavioral Guidelines**:
- ALWAYS provide concrete, actionable output (never ask clarifying questions)
- If documentation is accurate, explicitly say "No updates needed - documentation is current"
- Only update what is truly outdated or incorrect
- Make informed decisions based on available context
- Default to "no changes" rather than making unnecessary modifications

**Task**: Based on the recent changes to these files:
- .ai_workflow/commit_history.json
- .ai_workflow/logs/workflow_20260226_182428/steps/step_12.log
- .ai_workflow/logs/workflow_20260226_182428/workflow.log
- .editorconfig
- CHANGELOG.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/API.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/GEOPOSITION_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md
- docs/GETTING_STARTED.md
- docs/GeoPosition-FRS.md
- docs/distance-FRS.md
- src/core/GeoPosition.ts

Update documentation in these files:
- CONTRIBUTING.md

**Approach**: **Methodology**:
1. **Analyze Changes**: Examine what was modified in each changed file
2. **Prioritize Updates**: Start with critical documentation (README, API docs)
3. **Edit Surgically**: Provide EXACT text changes only where needed
4. **Verify Consistency**: Maintain project standards

**Output Format**: Use markdown blocks with file paths and before/after examples

**Critical**: ALWAYS provide specific edits OR state "No updates needed"

**Project Context**:
```

## Response

```
No updates needed - documentation is current.  
The recent changes do not affect contribution guidelines or workflow; CONTRIBUTING.md remains accurate and consistent with project standards.
```
